an actor or actress is a person who portrays a character in a production the actor performs in the flesh in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film radio and television the analogous greek term is upokrites hupokrites literally one who answers the actors of a rolethe art of to the role played whether based on a real person or fictional character this can also be considered an actors role which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters occurs even when the actor is playing themselves as in some forms of experimental performance art formerly in ancient greece and the medieval world and in england at the time of william shakespeare only men could become actors and womens roles were generally played by men or boys while ancient rome did allow female stage performers only a small minority of them were given speaking parts the commedia dellarte of italy however allowed professional women to perform early on lucrezia di siena whose name is on a contract of actors from october has been referred to as the first italian actress known by name with vincenza armani and barbara flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first actresses in italy and in europe after the english restoration of women began to appear onstage in england in modern times particularly in pantomime and some operas women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men history the first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in bc though the changes in the calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly when the greek performer thespis stepped onto the stage at the theatre dionysus to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story before thespis act grecian stories were only expressed in song dance and in third person narrative in honor of thespis actors are commonly called thespians the exclusively male actors in the theatre of ancient greece performed in three types of drama tragedy comedy and the satyr play this developed and expanded considerably under the romans the theatre of ancient rome was a thriving and diverse art form ranging from festival performances of street theatre nude dancing and acrobatics to the staging of situation comedies to highstyle verbally elaborate tragedies as the western roman empire fell into decay through the th and th centuries the seat of roman power was moved eastward to records show that mime pantomime scenes or recitations from tragedies and comedies dances and other were very popular from the th century western europe was plunged into a period of general disorder small nomadic bands of actors traveled around europe throughout the period performing wherever they could find an audience there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes actors were not of high status therefore in the early middle ages traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust early middle ages actors were denounced by the church during the dark ages as they were viewed as dangerous immoral and pagan in many parts of europe traditional beliefs of the region and time meant actors could not receive a christian burial in the early middle ages churches in europe began staging dramatized versions of biblical events by the middle of the th century liturgical drama had spread from russia to scandinavia to italy the feast of fools encouraged the development of comedy in the late middle ages plays were produced in towns these vernacular mystery plays often contained comedy with actors playing devils villains and clowns the majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population amateur performers in england were exclusively male but other countries had female performers there were several secular plays staged in the middle ages the earliest of which is the play of the greenwood by adam de la halle in it contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences farces also rose in popularity after the th century at the end of the late middle ages professional actors began to appear in england and europe richard iii and henry vii both maintained small companies of professional actors beginning in the midth century commedia dellarte troupes performed lively playlets across europe for centuries commedia dellarte was an actorcentred theatre requiring little scenery and very few props plays were loose frameworks that provided situations and the outcome of the action around which the actors improvised the plays used stock characters a troupe typically consisted of to members most actors were paid a share of the plays profits roughly equivalent to the sizes of their roles renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions such as the mystery plays morality plays and the university drama that attempted to recreate athenian tragedy the italian tradition of commedia dellarte as well as the elaborate masques frequently presented at court also contributed to the shaping of public theatre since before the reign of elizabeth i companies of players were attached to the households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations these became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the elizabethan stage the development of the theatre and for acting ceased when puritan opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within london puritans viewed the theatre as immoral the reopening of the theatres in signaled a renaissance of english drama english comedies written and performed in the restoration period from to are collectively called restoration comedy restoration comedy is notorious for its sexual explicitness at this point women were allowed for the first time to appear on the english stage exclusively in female roles this period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses and the rise of the first celebrity actors th century in the th century the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed and acting became an honored popular profession and art the rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition as audiences flocked to their favorite stars a new role emerged for the who formed their own companies and controlled the actors the productions and the financing when successful they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions they could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country performing a repertoire of wellknown plays such as those by shakespeare the newspapers private clubs pubs and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions henry irving was the most successful of the british irving was renowned for his roles and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience his company toured across britain as well as europe and the united states the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences his knighthood in indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of british society th century by the early th century the economics of largescale productions displaced the actormanager model it was too hard to find people who combined a genius at acting as well as management so divided the roles as stage managers and later theatre directors emerged financially much larger capital was required to operate out of a major city the solution was corporate ownership of chains of theatres such as by the theatrical syndicate edward laurillard and especially the shubert organization by catering to tourists theaters in large cities increasingly favored long runs of highly popular plays especially musicals big name stars became even more essential techniques classical acting is a philosophy of acting that integrates the expression of the body voice imagination external stimuli and script analysis it is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors including konstantin stanislavski and michel saintdenis in system also known as method actors draw upon their own feelings and experiences to convey the truth of the character they portray actors puts themselves in the mindset of the character finding things in common to give a more genuine portrayal of the character method acting is a range of techniques based on for training actors to achieve better of the characters they play as formulated by lee strasberg strasbergs method is based upon the idea that to develop an emotional and cognitive of their roles actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters it is based on aspects of system other acting techniques are also based on ideas such as those of stella adler and sanford meisner but these are not considered method acting meisner technique requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though they are real and they only exist in that moment this is a method that makes the actors in the scene seem more authentic to the audience it is based on the principle that acting finds its expression in peoples response to other people and is it based on system as the opposite gender formerly in some societies only men could become actors in ancient greece and ancient rome and the medieval world it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage nevertheless women did perform in ancient rome and again entered the stage in the commedia dellarte in italy in the th century lucrezia di siena became the perhaps first professional actress since ancient rome france and spain too also had female actors in the th century in william shakespeares england however womens roles were generally played by men or boyswhen an eighteenyear puritan prohibition of drama was lifted after the english restoration of women began to appear on stage in england margaret hughes is often credited as the first professional actress on the english stage previously angelica martinelli a member of a visiting italian commedia dellarte company did perform in england as early as but such foreign guest appearances had been rare exceptions and there had been no professional english actresses in england this prohibition ended during the reign of charles ii in part because he enjoyed watching actresses on stage specifically charles ii issued letters patent to thomas killigrew and william davenant granting them the monopoly right to form two london theatre companies to perform serious drama and the letters patent were reissued in with revisions allowing actresses to perform for the first to the oed the first occurrence of the term actress was in and is ascribed to middleton in the th century many viewed women in acting negatively as actresses were often courtesans and associated with promiscuity despite these prejudices the th century also saw the first female acting stars most notably sarah bernhardtin japan onnagata or men taking on female roles were used in kabuki theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the edo period this convention continues in some forms of chinese drama such as beijing opera men performed all the roles including female roles while in shaoxing opera women often play all roles including male onesin modern times women occasionally played the roles of boys or young men for example the stage role of peter pan is played by a woman as are most principal boys in british pantomime opera has several breeches roles sung by women usually examples are hansel in hansel und gretel cherubino in the marriage of figaro and octavian in der women playing male roles are uncommon in film with notable exceptions in stina ekblad played the mysterious ismael retzinsky in fanny and alexander and linda hunt received the academy award for best supporting actress for playing billy kwan in the year of living dangerously in cate blanchett was nominated for the academy award for best supporting actress for playing jude quinn a of bob dylan in the s in im not there in the s women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in of older plays such as works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a longstanding tradition in comic theatre and film most of shakespeares comedies include instances of overt such as francis flute in a midsummer nights dream the movie a funny thing happened on the way to the forum stars jack gilford dressing as a young bride tony curtis and jack lemmon famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the billy wilder film some like it hot for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the carry on films dustin hoffman and robin williams have each appeared in a hit comedy film tootsie and mrs doubtfire respectively in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman occasionally the issue is further complicated for example by a woman playing a woman acting as a manwho then pretends to be a woman such as julie andrews in or gwyneth paltrow in shakespeare in love in its pat the movie filmwatchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters pat and chris played by julia sweeney and dave foley similarly in the example of the marriage of figaro there is a scene in which cherubino a male character portrayed by a woman dresses up and acts like a woman the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation while the audience is aware of two levels a few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role edna turnblad in hairspray was played by divine in the original film harvey fierstein in the broadway musical and john travolta in the movie musical eddie redmayne was nominated for an academy award for playing lili elbe a trans woman in s the danish girl the term actress in contrast to ancient greek theatre ancient roman theatre did allow female performers while the majority of them were seldom employed in speaking roles but rather for dancing there was a minority of actresses in rome employed in speaking roles and also those who achieved wealth fame and recognition for their art such as eucharis dionysia galeria copiola and fabia arete and they also formed their own acting guild the sociae mimae which was evidently quite wealthy the profession seemingly died out in late antiquity while women did not begin to perform onstage in england until the second half of the th century they did appear in italy spain and france from the late thcentury onward lucrezia di siena whose name is on an acting contract in rome from october has been referred to as the first italian actress known by name with vincenza armani and barbara flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first actresses in italy and europeafter in england when women first started to appear on stage the terms actor or actress were initially used for female performers but later influenced by the french actrice actress became the commonly used term for women in theater and film the etymology is a simple derivation from actor with ess added when referring to groups of performers of both sexes actors is the profession the readoption of the neutral term dates to the postwar period of the and s when the of women to cultural life in general were being reviewed when the observer and the guardian published their new joint style guide in it stated use actor for both male and female actors do not use actress except when in name of award eg oscar for best actress the guides authors stated that actress comes into the same category as authoress comedienne manageress lady doctor male nurse and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex usually men see male as norm as whoopi goldberg put it in an interview with the paper an actress can only play a woman im an actor i can play anything the uk performers union equity has no policy on the use of actor or actress an equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the subject divides the profession in the los angeles times stated that actress remains the common term used in major acting awards given to female recipients eg academy award for best actress with regard to the cinema of the united states the term player was common in film in the silent film era and the early days of the motion picture production code but in the s in a film context it is generally deemed archaic however player remains in use in the theatre often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company such as the american players the east west players etc also actors in theatre may be referred to as players compensation gender pay gap in forbes reported that just of the topgrossing films of featured a female lead or colead while only of

radio have to learn specific skills techniques that work well in one type of acting may not work well in another type of acting in theatre to act on stage actors need to learn the stage directions that appear in the script such as stage left and stage right these directions are based on the actors point of view as they stand on the stage facing the audience actors also have to learn the meaning of the stage directions upstage away from the audience and downstage towards the audience theatre actors need to learn blocking which is where and how an actor moves on the stage during a play most scripts specify some blocking the director also gives instructions on blocking such as crossing the stage or picking up and using a propsome theater actors need to learn stage combat which is simulated fighting on stage actors may have to simulate handtohand fighting or actors are coached by fight directors who help them learn the sequence of fight actions in film silent films from to the late s movies were silent films silent film actors emphasized body language and facial expression so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen much silent film acting is apt to strike modernday audiences as simplistic or campy the melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience vaudeville theatre was an especially popular origin for many american silent film actors the pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director marshall neilan in the sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out the better for the pictures in other cases directors such as john griffith wray required their actors to deliver expressions for emphasis as early as american viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on film directors in europe and the united states recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early s silent films became less vaudevillian in the mids as the differences between stage and screen became apparent due to the work of directors such as d w griffith became less stagelike and the closeup shot allowed subtle and naturalistic acting in america dw griffiths company biograph studios became known for its innovative direction and acting conducted to suit the cinema rather than the stage griffith realized that theatrical acting did not look good on film and required his actors and actresses to go through weeks of film acting gish has been called films first true actress for her work in the period as she pioneered new film performing techniques recognizing the crucial differences between stage and screen acting directors such as albert capellani and maurice tourneur began to insist on naturalism in their films by the mids many american silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic lowkey acting straight away as late as films featuring acting styles such as metropolis were still being to anton kaes a silent film scholar from the university of wisconsin american silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between and influenced by techniques found in german silent film this is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the weimar republic including film directors producers cameramen lighting and stage technicians as well as actors and actresses the advent of sound in film film actors have to learn to get used to and be comfortable with a camera being in front of them film actors need to learn to find and stay on their mark this is a position on the floor marked with tape this position is where the lights and camera focus are optimized film actors also need to learn how to prepare well and perform well onscreen tests screen tests are a filmed audition of part of the script unlike theater actors who develop characters for repeat performances film actors lack continuity forcing them to come to all scenes sometimes shot in reverse of the order in which they ultimately appear with a fully developed character alreadysince film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater the performance of emotion is the most difficult aspect of film acting to master the film actor must rely on subtle facial ticks quivers and tiny lifts of the eyebrow to create a believable character some theatre stars have made the transition quite successfully laurence olivier glenn close and julie andrews for instance others have not in television on a television set there are typically several cameras angled at the set actors who are new to onscreen acting can get confused about which camera to look into tv actors need to learn to use lav mics lavaliere microphones tv actors need to understand the concept of frame the term frame refers to the area that the cameras lens is capturing within the acting industry there are four types of television roles one could land on a show each type varies in prominence frequency of appearance and pay the first is known as a series regularthe main actors on the show as part of the permanent cast actors in recurring roles are under contract to appear in multiple episodes of a series a costar role is a small speaking role that usually only appears in one episode a guest star is a larger role than a costar role and the character is often the central focus of the episode or integral to the plot in radio radio drama is a dramatized purely acoustic performance broadcast on radio or published on audio media such as tape or cd with no visual component radio

that orders a bank or credit union to pay a specific amount of money from a persons account to the person in whose name the cheque has been issued the person writing the cheque known as the drawer has a transaction banking account often called a current cheque chequing checking or share draft account where the money is held the drawer writes various details including the monetary amount date and a payee on the cheque and signs it ordering their bank known as the drawee to pay the amount of money stated to the payee although forms of cheques have been in use since ancient times and at least since the th century they became a highly popular noncash method for making payments during the th century and usage of cheques peaked by the second half of the th century as cheque processing became automated billions of cheques were issued annually these volumes peaked in or around the early s since then cheque usage has fallen being partly replaced by electronic payment systems such as debit cards and credit cards in an increasing number of countries cheques have either become a marginal payment system or have been completely phased out nature of a cheque a cheque is a negotiable instrument instructing a financial institution to pay a specific amount of a specific currency from a specified account held in the drawers name with that institution both the drawer and payee may be natural persons or legal entities cheques are order instruments and are not in general payable simply to the bearer as bearer instruments are but must be paid to the payee in some countries such as the us the payee may endorse the cheque allowing them to specify a third party to whom it should be paid cheques are a type of bill of exchange that were developed as a way to make payments without the need to carry large amounts of money paper money evolved from promissory notes another form of negotiable instrument similar to cheques in that they were originally a written order to pay the given amount to whoever had it in their possession the bearer spelling and etymology check is the original spelling the newer spelling cheque is believed to have come into use around when the switch was made by james william gilbart in his practical treatise on banking the spellings check checque and cheque were used from the th century until the th century however since the th century in the commonwealth and ireland the spelling cheque from the french word cheque has become standard for the financial instrument while check is used only for other meanings thus the two definitions in writingin american english the usual spelling for both is dictionaries attribute the financial meaning of check to come from a check against forgery with the use of check to mean control stemming from a check in chess a term which came into english through french latin arabic and ultimately from the persian word shah or king history the cheque had its origins in the ancient banking system in which bankers would issue orders at the request of their customers to pay money to identified payees such an order was referred to as a bill of exchange the use of bills of exchange facilitated trade by eliminating the need for merchants to carry large quantities of currency for example gold to purchase goods and services early years there is early evidence of using bill of exchange in india during the maurya empire from to bc a commercial instrument called the adesha was in use which was an order on a banker desiring him to pay the money of the note to a third personthe ancient romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as in the st century bcbeginning in the third century ad banks in persian territory began to issue letters of credit these letters were termed cak meaning document or contract the cak became the sakk later used by traders in the abbasid caliphate and other arabruled lands transporting a paper sakk was more secure than transporting money in the ninth century a merchant in one country could cash a sakk drawn on his bank in another country the persian poet ferdowsi used the term cheque several times in his famous book shahnameh when referring to the sasanid dynasty ibn hawqal living in the th century records the use of a cheque written in aoudaghost which was worth dinarsin the th century the bill of exchange was developed in venice as a legal device to allow trade without the need to carry large amounts of gold and silver their use subsequently spread to other european countries in the early s to protect large of cash people in the dutch republic began depositing their money with cashiers these cashiers held the money for a fee competition drove cashiers to offer additional services including paying money to any person bearing a written order from a depositor to do so they kept the note as proof of payment this concept went on to spread to england and elsewhere modern era by the th century bills of exchange were being used for domestic payments in england cheques a type of bill of exchange then began to evolve initially they were called drawn notes because they enabled a customer to draw on the funds that he or she had in the account with a bank and required immediate payment these were handwritten and one of the earliest known still to be in existence was drawn on messrs morris and clayton scriveners and bankers based in the city of london and dated february in the bank of england pioneered the first use of a preprinted form these forms were printed on cheque paper to prevent fraud and customers had to attend in person and obtain a numbered form from the cashier once written the cheque was brought back to the bank for settlement the suppression of banknotes in england further promoted the use of chequesuntil about an informal exchange of cheques took place between london banks clerks of each bank visited all the other banks to exchange cheques while keeping a tally of balances between them until they settled with each other daily cheque clearing began around when the bank clerks met at the five bells a tavern in lombard street in the city of london to exchange all their cheques in one place and settle the balances in cash this was the first bankers clearing house provincial were established in major cities throughout the uk to facilitate the clearing of cheques on banks in the same town birmingham bradford bristol hull leeds leicester liverpool manchester newcastle nottingham sheffield and southampton all had their own america the bank of new york began issuing cheques after its by alexander hamilton in the oldest surviving example of a complete american chequebook from the s was discovered by a family in new jersey the documents are in some ways similar to modernday cheques with some data preprinted on sheets of paper alongside blank spaces for where other information could be handwritten as neededit is thought that the commercial bank of scotland was the first bank to personalize its customers cheques in by printing the name of the account holder vertically along the lefthand edge in the bank of england introduced books of and forms and counterparts bound or stitched these cheque books became a common format for the distribution of cheques to bank customers in the late th century several countries formalized laws regarding cheques the uk passed the bills of exchange act and india passed the negotiable instruments act which both covered cheques in an attempt was made to simplify the use of cheques by the geneva convention on the unification of the law relating to cheques many european and south american states as well as japan joined the convention however countries including the us and members of the british commonwealth did not participate and so it remained very difficult for cheques to be used across country borders in a standard for characters micr was agreed upon and patented in the us for use with cheques this opened the way for the first automated machines for clearing cheques as automation increased the following years saw a dramatic change in the way in which cheques were handled and processed cheque volumes continued to grow in the late th century cheques were the most popular noncash method for making payments with billions of them processed each year most countries saw cheque volumes peak in the late s or early s after which electronic payment methods became more popular and the use of cheques declined in cheque guarantee cards were introduced in several countries allowing a retailer to confirm that a cheque would be honored when used at a point of sale the drawer would sign the cheque in front of the retailer who would compare the signature to the signature on the card and then write the number on the back of the cheque such cards were generally phased out and replaced by debit cards starting in the mids from the mids many countries enacted laws to allow for cheque truncation in which a physical cheque is converted into electronic form for transmission to the paying bank or this eliminates the cumbersome physical presentation and saves time and processing costs in the eurocheque system was phased out and replaced with domestic clearing systems old eurocheques could still be used but they were now processed by national clearing systems at that time several countries took the opportunity to phase out the use of cheques altogether as of many countries have either phased out the use of cheques altogether or signaled that they would do so in the future parts of a cheque the four main items on a cheque are drawer the person or entity whose transaction account is to be drawn usually the drawers name and account is preprinted on the cheque and the drawer is usually the signatory payee the person or entity who is to be paid the amount drawee the bank or other financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment this is usually preprinted on the cheque amount the currency amount the amount and currency eg dollars pounds etc usually must be written in words and in figures the currency is usually the local currency but may be a foreign currencyas cheque usage increased during the th and th centuries additional items were added to increase security or to make processing easier for the financial institution a signature of the drawer was required to authorize the cheque and this is the main way to authenticate the cheque second it became customary to write the amount in words as well as in numbers to avoid mistakes and make it harder to fraudulently alter the amount after the cheque had been written it is not a legal requirement to write the amount in words although some banks will refuse to accept cheques that do not have the amount in both numbers and words an issue date was added and cheques may become invalid a certain amount of time after issue in the us and canada a cheque is typically valid for six months after the date of issue after which it is a staledated cheque but this depends on where the cheque is drawn in australia a cheque is typically valid for fifteen months of the cheque date a cheque that has an issue date in the future a postdated cheque may not be able to be presented until that date has passed in some countries writing a post dated cheque may simply be ignored or is illegal conversely an antedated cheque has an issue date in the past a cheque number was added and cheque books were issued so that cheque numbers were sequential this allowed for some basic fraud detection by banks and made sure one cheque was not presented twice in some countries such as the us cheques may contain a memo line where the purpose of the cheque can be indicated as a convenience without affecting the official parts of the cheque in the united kingdom a memo line is not available and such notes may be written on the reverse side of the cheque in the us at the top when cheque oriented vertically of the reverse side of the cheque there are usually one or more blank lines labelled something like endorse here starting in the s routing and account information was added to the bottom of cheques in micr format which allowed automated sorting and routing of cheques between banks and led to automated central clearing facilities the information provided at the bottom of the cheque is and standards are set by each countrys cheque clearing system this means that the payee no longer has to go to the bank that issued the cheque they can instead deposit it at their own bank or any other bank and the cheque would be routed back to the originating bank and funds transferred to their own bank account in the us the bottom inch mm of the cheque is reserved for micr characters only intrusion into the micr area can cause problems when the cheque runs through the requiring someone to print an micr cheque correction strip and glue it to the cheque many new atms do not use deposit envelopes and actually scan the cheque at the time it is deposited and will reject cheques due to handwriting incursion which interferes with reading the micr this can cause considerable as the depositor may have to wait days for the bank to be open and may have difficulty getting to the bank even when they are open this can delay the availability of the portion of a deposit which their bank makes available immediately as well as the balance of the deposit terms of service for many mobile cell phone camera deposits also require the micr section to be readable not all of the micr characters have been printed at the time the cheque is written as additional characters will be printed later to encode the amount thus a sloppy signature could obscure characters that will later be printed there since micr characters are no longer necessarily printed in magnetic ink and will be scanned by optical rather than magnetic means the readers will be unable to distinguish pen ink from preprinted magnetic ink these changes allow cheques to be printed on ordinary home and office printers without requiring preprinted cheque forms allow atm deposit capture allow mobile deposits and facilitate electronic copies of cheques for additional protection a cheque can be crossed which restricts the use of the cheque so that the funds must be paid into a bank account the format and wording varies from country to country but generally two parallel lines may be placed either vertically across the cheque or in the top left hand corner in addition the words or bearer must not be used or if preprinted on the cheque must be crossed out on the payee line if the cheque is crossed with the words account payee or similar then the cheque can only be paid into the bank account of the person initially named as the payee thus it cannot be endorsed to a different payee attached documents cheques sometimes include additional documents a page in a chequebook may consist of both the cheque itself and a stub or counterfoil when the cheque is written only the cheque itself is detached and the stub is retained in the chequebook as a record of the cheque cheques may be recorded with carbon paper behind each cheque in ledger sheets between cheques or at the back of a chequebook or in a completely separate transaction register that comes with a chequebook when a cheque is mailed a separate letter or remittance advice may be attached to inform the recipient of the purpose of the cheque formally which account receivable to credit the funds to this is frequently done formally using a provided slip when paying a bill or informally via a letter when sending an ad hoc cheque usage parties to regular cheques generally include a drawer the depositor writing a cheque a drawee the financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment and a payee the entity to whom the drawer issues the cheque the drawer drafts or draws a cheque which is also called cutting a cheque especially in the us there may also be a example in depositing a cheque with a custodian of a brokerage account the payee will be the custodian but the cheque may be marked fbo for the benefit of the beneficiary ultimately there is also at least one endorsee which would typically be the financial institution servicing the payees account or in some may be a third party to whom the payee owes or wishes to give money a payee that accepts a cheque will typically deposit it in an account at the payees bank and have the bank process the cheque in some cases the payee will take the cheque to a branch of the drawee bank and cash the cheque there if a cheque is refused at the drawee bank or the drawee bank returns the cheque to the bank that it was deposited at because there are insufficient funds for the cheque to clear it is said that the cheque has been dishonoured once a cheque is approved and all appropriate accounts involved have been credited the cheque is stamped with some kind of cancellation mark such as a paid stamp the cheque is now a cancelled cheque cancelled cheques are placed in the account holders file the account holder can request a copy of a cancelled cheque as proof of a payment this is known as the cheque clearing cycle cheques can be lost or go astray within the cycle or be delayed if further verification is needed in the case of suspected fraud a cheque may thus bounce some time after it has been deposited following concerns about the amount of time it took the cheque and credit clearing company to clear cheques the united kingdom office of fair trading set up a working group in to look at the cheque clearing cycle their report said that clearing times could be improved but that the costs associated with speeding up the cheque clearing cycle could not be justified considering the use of cheques was declining however they concluded the biggest problem was the unlimited time a bank could take to dishonour a cheque to address this changes were implemented so that the maximum time after a cheque was deposited that it could be dishonoured was six days what was known as the certainty of fate principle an advantage to the drawer of using cheques instead of debit card transactions is that they know the drawers bank will not release the money until several days later paying with a cheque and making a deposit before it clears the drawers bank is called kiting or floating and is generally illegal in the us but rarely enforced unless the drawer uses multiple chequing accounts with multiple institutions to increase the delay or to steal the funds declining use cheque usage has been declining for some years both for point of sale transactions for which credit cards debit cards or mobile payment apps are increasingly preferred and for third party payments for example bill payments where the decline has been accelerated by the emergence of telephone banking online banking and mobile banking being paperbased cheques are costly for banks to process in comparison to electronic payments so banks in many countries now discourage the use of cheques either by charging for cheques or by making the alternatives more attractive to customers in particular the handling of money transfer requires more effort and is the cheque has to be handed over in person or sent through mail the rise of automated teller machines atms means that small amounts of cash are often easily accessible so that it is sometimes unnecessary to write a cheque for such amounts instead alternatives to cheques payment systems other than cheques include cash debit card payments credit card payments direct debit initiated by payee direct credit initiated by payer ach in us giro in europe direct entry in australia wire transfer local and via banks and credit unions or else via major private vendors such as western union and moneygram electronic bill payments using internet banking online payment services eg wechat pay alipay paypal venmo unified payments interface phonepe paytm and worldpay money orders variations on regular cheques in addition to regular cheques a number of variations were developed to address specific needs or address issues when using a regular cheque cashiers cheques and bank drafts cashiers cheques and bankers drafts also known as bank cheques bankers cheques or treasurers cheques are cheques issued against the funds of a financial institution rather than an individual account holder typically the term cashiers check is used in the us and bankers draft is used in the uk and most of the commonwealth the mechanism differs slightly from country to country but in general the bank issuing the cheque or draft will allocate the funds at the point the cheque is drawn this provides a guarantee save for a failure of the bank that it will be honoured cashiers cheques are perceived to be as good as cash but they are still a cheque a sometimes exploited by scam artists a lost or stolen cheque can still be stopped like any other cheque so payment is not completely guaranteed certified cheque when a certified cheque is drawn the bank operating the account verifies there are currently sufficient funds in the drawers account to honour the cheque those funds are then set aside in the banks internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee thus a certified cheque cannot bounce and its liquidity is similar to cash absent failure of the bank the bank indicates this fact by making a notation on the face of the cheque technically called an acceptance payroll cheque a cheque used to pay wages may be referred to as a payroll cheque even when the use of cheques for paying wages and salaries became rare the vocabulary pay cheque still remained commonly used to describe the payment of wages and salaries payroll cheques issued by the military to soldiers or by some other government entities to their employees beneficiants and creditors are referred to as warrants warrants warrants look like cheques and clear through the banking system like cheques but are not drawn against cleared funds in a deposit account a cheque differs from a warrant in that the warrant is not necessarily payable on demand and may not be negotiable they are often issued by government entities such as the military to pay wages or suppliers in this case they are an instruction to the entitys treasurer department to pay the warrant holder on demand or after a specified maturity date travellers cheque a travellers cheque is designed to allow the person signing it to make an payment to someone else as a result of paying the issuer for that privilege travellers cheques can usually be replaced if lost or stolen and people frequently used them on holiday instead of cash as many businesses used to accept travellers cheques as currency the use of credit or debit cards has begun to replace the travellers cheque as the standard for vacation money due to their convenience and additional security for the retailer as a result many businesses no longer accept travellers cheques money or postal order a cheque sold by a post office bank or merchant such as a grocery store for payment in favour of a third party is referred to as a money order or postal order these are paid for in advance when the order is drawn and are guaranteed by the institution that issues them and can only be paid to the named third party this was a common way to send low value payments to third parties avoiding the risks associated with sending cash by post prior to the advent of electronic payment methods oversized cheques oversized cheques are often used in public events such as donating money to charity or giving out prizes such as publishers clearing house the cheques are commonly by inches cm x cm in size however according to the guinness book of world records the largest ever is by metres ft x ft until recently regardless of the size such cheques could still be redeemed for their cash value as long as they would have the same parts as a normal cheque although usually the oversized cheque is kept as a souvenir and a normal cheque is provided any bank could levy additional charges for clearing an oversized cheque most banks need to have the information on the bottom of cheques read so only very limited dimensions can be allowed due to standardised equipment payment vouchers in the us some public assistance programmes such as the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children or aid to families with dependent children make vouchers available to their which are good up to a certain monetary amount for purchase of grocery items deemed eligible under the particular programme the voucher can be deposited like any other cheque by a supermarket or other approved business cheques around the world asia in many asian countries cheques were never widely used and generally only used by the wealthy with cash being used for the majority of payments where cheques were used they have been declining rapidly by there was negligible consumer cheque usage in japan south korea and taiwan this declining trend was accelerated by these developed markets advanced financial services many of the developing countries in asia have seen an increasing use of electronic payment systems leapfrogging the less efficient chequing system altogether india india is one of the few countries in asia that did have significant cheque usage it had a long tradition of using cheques and passed laws formalising cheque usage as early as in cheques were still widely used as a means of payment in trade and also by individuals to pay other individuals or utility bills one of the reasons was that banks usually provided cheques for free to their individual account holders however cheques are now rarely accepted at point of sale in retail stores where cash and cards are payment methods of choice electronic payment transfer continued to gain popularity in india and like other countries this caused a subsequent reduction in volumes of cheques issued each year in the reserve bank of india reported there was a five percent decline in cheque usage compared to the previous year in the reserve bank of india reported that while cheque usage continued to decline the decrease was slow the bank attributed the slow pace of the decline due to the fact that cheque volume had briefly increased after in before continuing to fall as well as the efficiency of indias cheque clearing system israel cheques are widely used in the retail market between persons and for other payments the law rules that payments in cash cannot exceed nis so cheque payment is a legal term when that maximum is reached its possible to pay at the cash desk at the supermarket or shop by cheque or issue a check for annual school payments for a child utility bills and property tax can be paid by cheque at the post office moreover usually tenant issues twelve postdated cheques to the landlord after signing the rental agreement one cheque per month of the rental term additional cheques signed by a tenant with an open date and amount for utility providers to ensure that the tenant will leave no debts ten bounced cheques during a year will result in the restriction of cheques for the account and the bank will bounce new cheques for a year if the account owner continues to draw cheques during the restriction period that persons accounts in israeli banks will be denied from issuing cheques japan in japan cheques are called kogitte xiao qie shou and are governed by kogitte law bounced cheques are called fuwatari kogitte bu du rixiao qie shou if an account owner bounces two cheques in six months the bank will suspend the account for two years if the account belongs to a public company their stock will also be suspended from trading on the stock exchange which can lead to bankruptcy canada in canada cheque sizes and types endorsement requirements and micr tolerances are overseen by payments canada canadian cheques can legally be written in english french or inuktitut a telecheque is a paper payment item that resembles a cheque except that it is neither created nor signed by the payerinstead it is created and may be signed by a third party on behalf of the payer under cpa rules these are prohibited in the clearing system effective january canadas usage of cheques is less than that of the us and is declining rapidly at the urging of the canadian banking association the government of canada claims it is times more expensive to mail a cheque than to make a direct deposit the canadian payments association reported that in cheque use in canada accounted for only of total financial transactions the interac system which allows instant fund transfers via chip or magnetic strip and pin is widely used by merchants to the point that few brick and mortar merchants accept cheques many merchants accept interac debit payments but not credit card payments even though most interac terminals can support credit card payments financial institutions also facilitate transfers between accounts within different institutions with the email money transfer emt service cheques are still used for government payments payroll rent and utility bill payments though direct deposits and online or telephone bill payments are more widely and increasingly used the canadian government began phasing out all government cheques from april a void cheque has a special code called a micr magnetic ink character recognition that is used by the bank to process the payment the micr code consists of the cheque number transit number and account number the micr number on a cheque can be interpreted as follows the first three or six digits on the left represent the cheque number the next five digits represent the transit number such as a bank branch the next three digits represent the financial institution number the last sets of a few digits represent the persons account number europe in most european countries cheques are now rarely used even for third party payments in these countries it is standard practice for businesses to publish their bank details on invoices to facilitate the receipt of payments by giro even before the introduction of online banking it has been possible in some countries to make payments to third parties using atms which may accurately and rapidly capture invoice amounts due dates and payee bank details via a bar code reader to reduce keying in some countries entering the bank account number results in the bank revealing the name of the payee as an added safeguard against fraud in using a cheque the onus is on the payee to initiate the payment whereas with a giro transfer the onus is on the payer to effect the payment the writer of a paper cheque is pushing on a rope he cannot force money out of his own account and into the destinations account by writing the paper cheque he is handing the far end of the rope to the payee who will pull in his own good time in contrast giro is more akin to wire transfer in that the payer pushes his money away towards the payee the process is also procedurally more simple as no cheques are ever posted can claim to have been posted or need banking or clearance in germany austria switzerland the netherlands belgium luxembourg norway sweden finland denmark and iceland giro transfers have been standard procedure since the s for regular payments like rent and wages and even mailorder invoices in the netherlands austria and germany many invoices are accompanied by socalled acceptgiros netherlands or german which are essentially standardized bank transfer order forms preprinted with the payees account details and the amount payable the payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at his bank which will then transfer the money it is also very common to allow the payee to withdraw the requested amount from the payers account german or incasso machtiging netherlands though similar to paying by cheque the payee only needs the payers bank and account number since the early s this method of payment has also been available to merchants debit cards are widespread in these countries since virtually all banks issue debit cards instead of simple atm cards for use on current accounts acceptance of cheques has been further diminished since the late s because of the abolition of the eurocheque cashing a foreign bank cheque is possible but usually very expensive in finland banks stopped issuing personal cheques in about in favour of giro systems which are now almost exclusively initiated either via internet banking or payment machines located at banks and shopping malls all nordic countries have used an giro system since the s and in sweden cheques are now almost totally abandoned in denmark all banks stopped accepting cheques starting on january debit cards are now preferred for direct shop payments when not using cash for large shop payments such as car purchases a type of cheque a money order swedish postvaxel is still used in poland cheques were withdrawn from use in mainly because of lack of popularity due to the widespread adoption of credit and debit cards electronic payments across the european union are now fast and free for consumers in the united kingdom ireland france as well as to some extent in monaco italy and san marino cheques are still popular partly because cheques remain free of charge to personal customers however banktobank transfers are increasing in popularity france however remains well ahead of its european counterparts in the use of cheque payments as seen in where its estimated that more than billion cheque payments were made compared to italy the country with the next highest number of payments with under million

per cent of transactions an annual average of cheque transaction per capita kiwibank stopped accepting cheques as payment on february followed by anz on may westpac and bnz stopped accepting cheques on june and june respectively asb was the last major bank to phase out cheques on august australia the cheques act is the body of law governing the issuance of cheques and payment orders in australia procedural and practical issues governing the clearance of cheques and payment orders are handled by australian payments clearing association apca in banks adopted a system to allow faster clearance of cheques by transmitting information about cheques this brought clearance times down from five to three days previously cheques were required to be physically transported to the paying bank before processing began and dishonoured cheques were physically returned all licensed banks in australia may issue cheques in their own name nonbanks are not permitted to issue cheques in their own name but may issue and have drawn on them payment orders which functionally are no different from cheques new zealand legislation includes the cheques act part of the bills of exchange act which codifies aspects related to the cheque payment instrument notably the procedures for the endorsement presentment and payment of cheques a amendment provided for the electronic presentment of cheques and removed the previous requirement to deliver cheques physically to the paying bank opening the way for cheque truncation and imaging truncation allows for the transmission of an electronic image of all or part of the cheque to the paying banks branch instead of cumbersome physical presentment this reduced the total cheque clearance time and eliminated the costs of physically moving the cheque the registered banks under supervision of reserve bank of new zealand provide the cheque payment services once banked cheques are processed together with other retail payment instruments homeguard v kiwi packaging is often cited case law regarding the banking of cheques tendered as full settlement of disputed accountsin new zealand banks began phasing out of cheques and they are no longer accepted as payment all have moved to other types of payment systems united kingdom in the uk all cheques must now conform to an industry standard detailing layout and font cheque and credit clearing company cccc standard be printed on a specific weight of paper cbs and contain explicitly defined security features since all cheque printers must be members of the cheque printer scheme cpas the scheme is managed by the cheque and credit clearing company and requires that all cheques for use in the british clearing process are produced by accredited printers who have adopted stringent security standards the rules concerning crossed cheques are set out in section of the cheques act and prevent cheques being cashed by or paid into the accounts of third parties on a crossed cheque the words account payee only or similar are printed between two parallel vertical lines in the centre of the cheque this makes the cheque and is to avoid cheques being endorsed and paid into an account other than that of the named payee crossing cheques basically ensures that the money is paid into an account of the intended beneficiary of the cheque following concerns about the amount of time it took banks to clear cheques the united kingdom office of fair trading set up a working group in to look at the cheque clearing cycle they produced a report recommending maximum times for the cheque clearing which were introduced in uk from november in the report the date the credit appeared on the recipients account usually the day of deposit was designated t at t two business days afterwards the value would count for calculation of credit interest or overdraft interest on the recipients account at t clients would be able to withdraw funds on current accounts or at t on savings accounts though this will often happen earlier at the banks discretion t is the last day that a cheque can bounce without the recipients is known as certainty of fate before the introduction of this standard also known as for current accounts and for savings accounts the only way to know the fate of a cheque has been special presentation which would normally involve a fee where the drawee bank contacts the payee bank to see if the payee has that money at that time special presentation had been stated at the time of deposit cheque volumes peaked in when four billion cheque payments were made of these billion were cleared through the interbank clearing managed by the cccc the remaining billion being inhouse cheques which were either paid into the branch on which they were drawn or processed intrabank without going through the clearings as volumes started to fall the challenges faced by the clearing banks were then of a different nature how to benefit from technology improvements in a declining business environment although the uk did not adopt the euro as its national currency when other european countries did in many banks began offering euro denominated accounts with chequebooks principally to business customers the cheques can be used to pay for certain goods and services in the uk the same year the cccc set up the euro cheque clearing system to process euro denominated cheques separately from sterling cheques in great britain the uk payments council from june withdrew the existing cheque guarantee card scheme in the uk this service allowed cheques to be guaranteed at point of sales up to a certain value normally ps or ps when signed in front of the retailer with the additional cheque guarantee card this was after a long period of decline in their use in favour of debit cards the payments council proposed to close the centralised cheque clearing altogether in the uk and had set a target date of october however on july the payments council announced that after opposition from mps charity groups and public opinion the cheque will remain in use and there would no longer be a reason to seek an alternative paymentsince businesses in the united kingdom have made more electronic payments than cheque payments automated payments rose from million in to billion in and cheques declined in that same period of time from to billion payments most utilities in the united kingdom charge lower prices to customers who pay by direct debit than for other payment methods including electronic methods the vast majority of retailers in the united kingdom have not accepted cheques as a means of payment for several years and cheque guarantee cards are no longer issued for example shell announced in september that it would no longer accept cheques at their uk petrol stations this was soon followed by other major fuel retailers such as texaco bp and total asda announced in april that it would stop accepting cheques initially as a trial in the london area and boots announced in september that it would stop accepting cheques initially as a trial in sussex and surrey currys and other stores in the dsgi group and wh smith also no longer accept cheques cheques are now widely predicted to become a thing of the past or at most a niche product used to pay private individuals or for the very large number of small service providers who are not willing to provide their bank details to customers to allow electronic payments to be made to them or do not wish to be burdened with checking their bank accounts frequently and reconciling them with amounts due for example music teachers driving instructors childrens sports lessons small shops schoolsthe uk payments council announced in december that cheques would be phased out by october but only if adequate alternatives were developed they intended to perform annual checks on the progress of other payments systems and a final review of the decision would have been held in concerns were expressed however by charities and older people who are the main users of cheques and replacement plans were criticised as being open to fraud it was therefore announced by the uk payments council in july that the cheque would not be eliminated million interbank cheques and credititems worth ps were processed in the united kingdom in according to payments uk in million cheques worth ps billion were used for payments and acquiring cash an average of million cheques per day with more than million being cleared in northern ireland alone the cheque and credit clearing company noted that cheques continue to be highly valued for paying tradesmen and utility bills and play a vital role in business clubs and societies sectors with nine in business saying that they received or made payment by cheque on a monthly basisin june following a successful trial in the uk by barclays the uk government gave the goahead for a cheque truncation system allowing people to pay in a cheque by taking a photo of it rather than physically depositing the paper cheque at a bank united states in the united states cheques are referred to as checks and are governed by article of the uniform commercial code under the rubric of negotiable instruments an order checkthe most common form in the usis payable only to the named payee or endorsee as it usually contains the language pay to the order of name a bearer check is payable to anyone who is in possession of the document this would be the case if the cheque does not name a payee or is payable to bearer or to cash or to the order of cash or if the cheque is payable to someone who is not a person or legal entity for example if the payee line is marked happy birthday a counter check is one that a bank issues to an account holder in person this is typically done for customers who have opened a new account or have run out of personalized cheques it may lack the usual security featuresin the us the terminology for a cheque historically varied with the type of financial institution on which it is drawn in the case of a savings and loan association it was a negotiable order of withdrawal compare negotiable order of withdrawal account if a credit union it was a share draft checks were associated with chartered commercial banks however common usage has increasingly conformed to more recent versions of article where check means any or all of these negotiable instruments certain types of cheques drawn on a government agency especially payroll cheques may be called a payroll warrant at the bottom of each cheque there is the number in micr format the aba routing transit number is a ninedigit number in which the first four digits identifies the us federal reserve banks centre this is followed by digits through identifying the specific bank served by that centre digit is a verification check digit computed using a complex algorithm of the previous eight digits typically the routing number is followed by a group of eight or nine micr digits that indicates the particular account number at that bank the account number is assigned by the various banks typically the account number is followed by a group of three or four micr digits that indicates a particular cheque number from that account directional routing numberalso known as the transit number consists of a denominator mirroring the first four digits of the routing number and a hyphenated numerator also known as the aba number in which the first part is a city code if the account is in one of specific cities or a state code if it is not in one of those specific cities the second part of the hyphenated numerator mirrors the th through th digits of the routing number with leading zeros removeda draft in the us uniform commercial code is any bill of exchange whether payable on demand or at a later date if payable on demand it is a demand draft or if drawn on a financial institution a cheque the electronic cheque or substitute cheque was formally adopted in the us in with the passing of the check clearing for the st century act or check act this allowed the creation of electronic cheques and translation truncation of paper cheques into electronic replacements reducing cost and processing time the for us cheques is given by ansi committee x technical report in the us still relied heavily on cheques due to the convenience afforded to payers and due to the absence of a high volume system for lowvalue electronic payments in practice transfers of less than about five dollars are extremely expensive and transactions of less than c impossible transaction fees swallow the payment or exceed it the only methods generally available for individuals and small businesses to make payments are electronic funds transfers eft or accepting credit cards eft payments require a commercial chequing account which often has higher fees and minimum balances than individual accounts and a subscription to eft service costing anywhere from to a month plus c per transaction making transactions of c or less impossible and transactions under very expensive credit card payments cost the recipient or the payer c plus of the transaction making transactions of c or less impossible and transactions of or less have at least a service charge generally payments by cheque as long as the payer has funds in their account and the recipient deposits it to their bank account regardless of amount have a service charge to both parties of zero since the decline in cheque usage seen around the world has also started in the us the cheque although not as common as it used to be is still a long way from disappearing completely in the usin the us an estimated billion cheques were paid in with a value of billion cheques were written annually in the us by though around million adult americans have no bank accounts certain companies whom a person pays with a cheque will turn it into an automated clearing house ach or electronic transaction banks try to save time processing cheques by sending them between banks cheque clearing is usually done through an electronic cheque broker such as the clearing house viewpointe llc or the federal reserve banks copies of the cheques are stored at a bank or the broker for periods up to years and this is why some cheque archives have grown to petabytes the access to these archives is now worldwide as most bank programming is now done offshore many utilities and most credit cards will also allow customers to pay by providing bank information and having the payee draw payment from the customers account direct debit many people in the us pay their bills or transfer money via paper money orders as these have security advantages over mailing cash and require no bankaccount access turkey in turkey cheques are usually used for commercial transactions only and using postdated cheques is legally permissible cheque fraud cheques have been a tempting target for criminals to steal money or goods from the drawer payee or the banks a number of measures have been introduced to combat fraud over the years these range from things like writing a cheque so it is difficult to alter after it is drawn to mechanisms like crossing a cheque so that it can only be paid into another banks account providing some traceability however the inherent security weaknesses of cheques as a payment method such as having only the signature as the main method and not knowing if funds will be received until the clearing cycle is complete have made them vulnerable to a number of different types of fraud embezzlement taking advantage of the float period cheque kiting to delay the notice of nonexistent funds this often involves trying to convince a merchant or other recipient hoping the recipient will not suspect that the cheque will not clear giving time for the fraudster to disappear forgery sometimes forgery is the method of choice in defrauding a bank one form of forgery involves the use of a victims legitimate cheques that have either been stolen and then cashed or altering a cheque that has been legitimately written to the perpetrator by adding words or digits to inflate the amount identity theft since cheques include significant personal information name account number signature and in some countries drivers license number the address or phone number of the account holder they can be used for identity theft the practice was discontinued as identity theft became widespread dishonoured cheques a dishonoured cheque is literally one where the payment has not been honoured ie the payment has been refused by the payers bank for any of various reasons colloquially it is referred to as bounced such a cheque cannot be redeemed for its value and is worthless they are also known as an rdi returned deposit item or nsf funds cheque cheques are usually dishonoured because the drawers account has been frozen or limited or because there are insufficient funds in the drawers account when the cheque was redeemed a cheque drawn on an account with insufficient funds is said to have bounced and may be called a rubber cheque banks will typically charge customers for issuing a dishonoured cheque and in some such an act is a criminal action a drawer may also issue a stop on a cheque instructing the financial institution not to honour a particular cheque in england and wales they are typically returned marked refer to draweran instruction to contact the person issuing the cheque for an explanation as to why the cheque was not honoured this wording was brought in after a bank was successfully sued for libel after returning a cheque with the phrase insufficient funds after making an errorthe court ruled that as there were sufficient funds the statement was demonstrably false and damaging to the reputation of the person issuing the cheque despite the use of this revised phrase successful libel lawsuits brought against banks by individuals remained for similar errorsin scotland a cheque acts as an assignment of the amount of money to the payee as such if a cheque is dishonoured in scotland what funds are present in the bank account are attached and frozen until either sufficient funds are credited to the account to pay the cheque the drawer recovers the cheque and hands it into the bank or the drawer obtains a letter from the payee stating that they have no further interest in the cheque a cheque may also be dishonoured because it is stale or not cashed within a void after date many cheques have an explicit notice printed on the cheque that it is void after some period of days in the us banks are not required by the uniform commercial code to honour a staledated cheque which is a cheque presented six months after it is dated consumer reporting in the united states some consumer reporting agencies such as chexsystems early warning services and telecheck have been providing cheque verification services that track how people manage their chequing accounts banks use the agencies to screen chequing account applicants and those with low debit scores are denied because banks cannot afford overdrawn accountsin the united kingdom in common with other items such as direct debits or standing orders dishonoured cheques can be reported on a customers credit file although not individually and this does not happen universally amongst banks dishonoured payments from current accounts can be marked in the same manner as missed payments on the customers credit report lock box typically when customers pay bills with cheques like gas or water bills the mail will go to a lock box at the post office there a bank will pick up all the mail sort it open it take the cheques and remittance advice out process it all through electronic machinery and post the funds to the proper

comprise a large family of diseases that involve abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body they form a subset of neoplasms a neoplasm or tumor is a group of cells that have undergone unregulated growth and will often form a mass or lump but may be distributed diffuselyall tumor cells show the six hallmarks of cancer these are required to produce a malignant tumor they include cell growth and division absent the proper signals continuous growth and division even given contrary signals avoidance of programmed cell death limitless number of cell divisions promoting blood vessel construction invasion of tissue and formation of progression from normal cells to cells that can form a detectable mass to outright cancer involves multiple steps known as malignant progression signs and symptoms when cancer begins it produces no symptoms signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows or ulcerates the findings that result depend on cancers type and location few symptoms are specific many frequently occur in individuals who have other conditions cancer can be difficult to diagnose and can be considered a great may become anxious or depressed the risk of suicide in people with cancer is double local symptoms local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration for example mass effects from lung cancer can block the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus making it difficult or painful to swallow and colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel affecting bowel habits masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps ulceration can cause bleeding that can lead to symptoms such as coughing up blood lung cancer anemia or rectal bleeding colon cancer blood in the urine bladder cancer or abnormal vaginal bleeding endometrial or cervical cancer although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer the initial tumor is usually painless some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen systemic symptoms systemic symptoms may occur due to the bodys response to the cancer this may include fatigue weight loss or skin changes some cancers can cause a systemic inflammatory state that leads to ongoing muscle loss and weakness known as cachexiasome cancers such as hodgkins disease leukemias and liver or kidney cancers can cause a persistent feversome systemic symptoms of cancer are caused by hormones or other molecules produced by the tumor known as syndromes common syndromes include which can cause altered mental state constipation and dehydration or hyponatremia which can also cause altered mental status vomiting headaches or seizures metastasis metastasis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body the dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors while the original is called the primary tumor almost all cancers can metastasize most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the lymphatic system or both the typical steps in metastasis are local invasion into the blood or lymph circulation through the body into the new tissue and angiogenesis different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs liver brain and the bones causes the majority of cancers some of cases are due to genetic mutations from and lifestyle factors the remaining are due to inherited genetics refers to any cause that is not inherited such as lifestyle economic and behavioral factors and not merely pollution common factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco use diet and obesity infections radiation both ionizing and nonionizing up to lack of physical activity and pollution stress does not appear to be a risk factor for the onset of cancer though it may worsen outcomes in those who already have cancerit is not generally possible to prove what caused a particular cancer because the various causes do not have specific fingerprints for example if a person who uses tobacco heavily develops lung cancer then it was probably caused by the tobacco use but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air pollution or radiation the cancer may have developed for one of those reasons excepting the rare that occur with pregnancies and occasional organ donors cancer is generally not a disease however factors that may have contributed to the development of cancer can be such as oncoviruses like hepatitis b epsteinbarr virus and hiv chemicals exposure to particular substances have been linked to specific types of cancer these substances are called carcinogens tobacco smoke for example causes of lung cancer it also causes cancer in the larynx head neck stomach bladder kidney esophagus and pancreas tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic is responsible for about one in five cancer deaths worldwide and about one in three in the developed world lung cancer death rates in the united states have mirrored smoking patterns with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and more recently decreases in smoking rates since the s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since in western europe of cancers in males and of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol exposure especially liver and digestive tract cancers cancer from workrelated substance exposures may cause between and of cases causing at least deaths cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma can come from inhaling tobacco smoke or asbestos fibers or leukemia from exposure to to acid pfoa which is used in the production of teflon is known to cause two kinds of cancer diet and exercise diet physical inactivity and obesity are related to up to of cancer deaths in the united states excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in of cancer deaths a uk study including data on over million people showed higher body mass index to be related to at least types of cancer and responsible for around cases each year in that country physical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on the immune system and endocrine system more than half of the effect from the diet is due to eating too much rather than from eating too few vegetables or other healthful foods some specific foods are linked to specific cancers a highsalt diet is linked to gastric cancer aflatoxin b a frequent food contaminant causes liver cancer betel nut chewing can cause oral cancer national differences in dietary practices may partly explain differences in cancer incidence for example gastric cancer is more common in japan due to its highsalt diet while colon cancer is more common in the united states immigrant cancer profiles mirror those of their new country often within one generation infection worldwide of cancer deaths are related to infectious diseases this proportion ranges from a high of in africa to less than in the developed world viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but cancer bacteria and parasites may also play a role oncoviruses viruses that can cause cancer include human cervical cancer epsteinbarr virus bcell disease and carcinoma kaposis sarcoma herpesvirus kaposis sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas hepatitis b and hepatitis c viruses carcinoma and human tcell leukemia virus tcell leukemias bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer as seen in helicobacter gastric carcinoma parasitic infections associated with cancer include schistosoma haematobium squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder and the liver flukes opisthorchis viverrini and clonorchis sinensis radiation radiation exposure such as ultraviolet radiation and radioactive material is a risk factor for cancer many nonmelanoma skin cancers are due to ultraviolet radiation mostly from sunlight sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging and radon gasionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen residential exposure to radon gas for example has similar cancer risks as passive smoking radiation is a more potent source of cancer when combined with other agents such as radon plus tobacco smoke radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body in all animals and at any age children are twice as likely to develop leukemia as adults radiation exposure before birth has ten times the use of ionizing radiation is a small but growing source of cancers ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers but this may in some cases induce a second form of cancer it is also used in some kinds of medical exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation especially the nonionizing medium wave uvb as the cause of most nonmelanoma skin cancers which are the most common forms of cancer in the radio frequency radiation from mobile phones electric power transmission and other similar sources has been described as a possible carcinogen by the world health agency for research on cancer evidence however has not supported a concern this includes that studies have not found a consistent link between mobile phone radiation and cancer risk heredity the vast majority of cancers are sporadic hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect less than of the population are carriers of a genetic mutation that has a large effect on cancer risk and these cause less than of cancer some of these syndromes include certain inherited mutations in the genes brca and brca with a more than risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer hnpcc or lynch syndrome which is present in about of people with colorectal cancer among others for cancers causing most mortality the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer when a firstdegree relative parent sibling or child has been diagnosed with it is about the relative risk is for lung cancer and for prostate cancer for breast cancer the relative risk is with a firstdegree relative having developed it at years of age or older and when the relative developed it when being younger than years of agetaller people have an increased risk of cancer because they have more cells than shorter people since height is genetically determined to a large extent taller people have a heritable increase of cancer risk physical agents some substances cause cancer primarily through their physical rather than chemical effects a prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos naturally occurring mineral fibers that are a major cause of mesothelioma cancer of the serous membrane usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs other substances in this category including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestoslike fibers such as wollastonite attapulgite glass wool and rock wool are believed to have similar effects nonfibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel and crystalline silica quartz cristobalite and tridymite usually physical carcinogens must get inside the body such as through inhalation and require years of exposure to produce trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer for example have not been proven similarly physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer breast cancer or brain cancer one accepted source is frequent longterm application of hot objects to the body it is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters charcoal hand warmers may produce skin cancer especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present frequent consumption of scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer generally it is believed that cancer arises or a preexisting cancer is encouraged during the process of healing rather than directly by the trauma however repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation chronic inflammation has been hypothesized to directly cause mutation inflammation can contribute to survival angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing the tumor oncogenes build up an inflammatory hormones some hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell insulinlike growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell and apoptosis suggesting possible involvement in are important agents in sexrelated cancers such as cancer of the breast endometrium prostate ovary and testis and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer for example the daughters of women who have breast cancer have higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer these higher hormone levels may explain their higher risk of breast cancer even in the absence of a breastcancer gene similarly men of african ancestry have higher levels of testosterone than men of european ancestry and have a higher level of prostate cancer men of asian ancestry with the lowest levels of glucuronide have the lowest levels of prostate cancerother factors are relevant obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones on the other hand people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones and lower risk of cancer osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels and thus discouraging cancers autoimmune diseases there is an association between celiac disease and an increased risk of all cancers people with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis and strict treatment probably due to the adoption of a glutenfree diet which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease however the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a glutenfree diet seems to increase the risk of malignancies rates of cancers are increased in people with crohns disease and ulcerative colitis due to chronic inflammation also and biologic agents used to treat these diseases may promote developing malignancies genetics cancer is a disease of tissue growth regulation for a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell the genes that regulate cell growth and must be alteredthe affected genes are divided into two broad categories oncogenes are genes that promote cell growth and reproduction tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division and survival malignant can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes the of normal oncogenes or by the or disabling of tumor suppressor genes typically changes in multiple genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cellgenetic changes can occur at different levels and by different mechanisms the gain or loss of an entire chromosome can occur through errors in mitosis more common are mutations which are changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic dna largescale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome genomic occurs when a cell gains copies often or more of a small chromosomal locus usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused often at a location a wellknown example of this is the philadelphia chromosome or of chromosomes and which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia and results in production of the bcrabl fusion protein an oncogenic tyrosine kinase smallscale mutations include point mutations deletions and insertions which may occur in the promoter region of a gene and affect its expression or may occur in the genes coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a dna virus or retrovirus leading to the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants replication of the data contained within the dna of living cells will result in some errors mutations complex error correction and prevention are built into the process and safeguard the cell against cancer if a significant error occurs the damaged cell can selfdestruct through programmed cell death termed apoptosis if the error control processes fail then the mutations will survive and be passed along to daughter cells some environments make errors more likely to arise and propagate such environments can include the presence of disruptive substances called carcinogens repeated physical injury heat ionising radiation or hypoxiathe errors that cause cancer are and compounding for example a mutation in the machinery of a cell might cause that cell and its children to accumulate errors more rapidly a further mutation in an oncogene might cause the cell to reproduce more rapidly and more frequently than its normal counterparts a further mutation may cause loss of a tumor suppressor gene disrupting the apoptosis signaling pathway and the cell a further mutation in the signaling machinery of the cell might send errorcausing signals to nearby cellsthe of a normal cell into cancer is akin to a chain reaction caused by initial errors which compound into more severe errors each allowing the cell to escape more controls that limit normal tissue growth this scenario is an undesirable survival of the fittest where the driving forces of evolution work against the bodys design and enforcement of order once cancer has begun to develop this ongoing process termed clonal evolution drives progression towards more invasive stages clonal evolution leads to intratumour cancer cells with mutations that complicates designing effective treatment strategies and requires an evolutionary approach to designing treatment abilities developed by cancers are divided into categories specifically evasion of apoptosis in growth signals to antigrowth signals sustained angiogenesis limitless replicative potential metastasis of energy metabolism and evasion of immune destruction epigenetics the classical view of cancer is a set of diseases driven by progressive genetic that include mutations in genes and oncogenes and in chromosomal a role for epigenetic alterations was identified in the early st alterations are functionally relevant to the genome that do not change the nucleotide sequence examples of such are changes in dna methylation and histone modification and changes in chromosomal architecture caused by expression of proteins such as hmga or hmga each of these alterations regulates gene expression without altering the underlying dna sequence these changes may remain through cell divisions endure for multiple generations and can be considered as equivalent to mutations epigenetic alterations occur frequently in cancers as an example one study listed protein coding genes that were frequently altered in their methylation in association with colon cancer these included and genes of the genes were in of colon cancers and many others were in more than of colon cancerswhile epigenetic alterations are found in cancers the epigenetic alterations in dna repair genes causing reduced expression of dna repair proteins may be of particular importance such alterations may occur early in progression to cancer and are a possible cause of the genetic instability of expression of dna repair genes disrupts dna repair this is shown in the figure at the th level from the top in the figure red wording indicates the central role of dna damage and defects in dna repair in progression to cancer when dna repair is deficient dna damage remains in cells at a higher than usual level th level and causes increased frequencies of mutation andor epimutation th level mutation rates increase in cells defective in dna mismatch repair or in homologous repair hrr chromosomal and aneuploidy also increase in hrr defective cellshigher levels of dna damage cause increased mutation right side of figure and increased epimutation during repair of dna double strand breaks or repair of other dna damage incompletely cleared repair sites can cause epigenetic gene expression of dna repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can increase cancer risks individuals with an inherited impairment in any of dna repair genes see article dna disorder have increased cancer risk with some defects ensuring a lifetime chance of cancer eg p mutations germ line dna repair mutations are noted on the figures left side however such germline mutations which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes are the cause of only about percent of cancersin sporadic cancers deficiencies in dna repair are occasionally caused by a mutation in a dna repair gene but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of dna repair genes this is indicated in the figure at the rd level many studies of heavy metalinduced show that such heavy metals cause a reduction in expression of dna repair enzymes some through epigenetic mechanisms dna repair inhibition is proposed to be a predominant mechanism in heavy metalinduced in addition frequent epigenetic alterations of the dna sequences code for small rnas called micrornas or mirnas mirnas do not code for proteins but can target genes and reduce their expression cancers usually arise from an assemblage of mutations and epimutations that confer a selective advantage leading to clonal expansion see field defects in progression to cancer mutations however may not be as frequent in cancers as epigenetic alterations an average cancer of the breast or colon can have about to mutations of which about three or four may be driver mutations and the remaining ones may be passenger mutations metastasis metastasis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body the dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors while the original is called the primary tumor almost all cancers can metastasize most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the lymphatic system or both the typical steps in metastasis are local invasion into the blood or lymph circulation through the body into the new tissue and angiogenesis different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs liver brain and the bones metabolism normal cells typically generate only about of energy from glycolysis whereas most cancers rely on glycolysis for energy production warburg effect but a minority of cancer types rely on oxidative as the primary energy source including lymphoma leukemia and endometrial cancer even in these cases however the use of glycolysis as an energy source rarely exceeds a few cancers use glutamine as the major energy source partly because it provides nitrogen required for nucleotide dna rna synthesis cancer stem cells often use oxidative or glutamine as a primary energy studies have indicated that the enzyme sirtuin is selectively inactivated during oncogenesis in a variety of tumor types by inducing glycolysis another sirtuin sirtuin inhibits cancers that depend upon glycolysis but promotes cancers that depend upon oxidative diet ketogenic diet has sometimes been recommended as a supportive therapy for cancer treatment diagnosis most cancers are initially recognized either because of the appearance of signs or symptoms or through screening neither of these leads to a definitive diagnosis which requires the examination of a tissue sample by a pathologist people with suspected cancer are investigated with medical tests these commonly include blood tests xrays contrast ct scans and endoscopy the tissue diagnosis from the biopsy indicates the type of cell that is its histological grade genetic and other features together this information is useful to evaluate the prognosis and to choose the best treatment cytogenetics and are other types of tissue tests these tests provide information about molecular changes such as mutations fusion genes and numerical chromosome changes and may thus also indicate the prognosis and best treatment cancer diagnosis can cause distress and psychosocial such as talking therapy may help people with this cancers are classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells resemble and is therefore presumed to be the origin of the tumor these types include carcinoma cancers derived from epithelial cells this group includes many of the most common cancers and include nearly all those in the breast prostate lung pancreas and colon sarcoma cancers arising from connective tissue ie bone cartilage fat nerve each of which develops from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside the bone marrow lymphoma and leukemia these two classes arise from bloodforming cells that leave the marrow and tend to mature in the lymph nodes and blood respectively germ cell tumor cancers derived from pluripotent cells most often presenting in the testicle or the ovary seminoma and dysgerminoma respectively blastoma cancers derived from immature precursor cells or embryonic are usually named using carcinoma sarcoma or blastoma as a suffix with the latin or greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root for example cancers of the liver parenchyma arising from malignant epithelial cells is called while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a and a cancer arising from fat cells is called a liposarcoma for some common cancers the english organ name is used for example the most common type of breast cancer is called ductal carcinoma of the breast here the adjective ductal refers to the appearance of cancer under the microscope which suggests that it has originated in the milk ducts benign tumors which are not cancers are named using oma as a suffix with the organ name as the root for example a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a leiomyoma the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is fibroid confusingly some types of cancer use the noma suffix examples including melanoma and seminoma some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope such as giant cell carcinoma spindle cell carcinoma and smallcell carcinoma prevention cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease cancer risk the vast majority of cancer cases are due to risk factors many of these factors are controllable lifestyle choices thus cancer is generally preventable between and of common cancers are due to factors and therefore potentially than of cancer deaths could be prevented by avoiding risk factors including tobacco excess poor diet physical inactivity alcohol sexually transmitted infections and air pollution further poverty could be considered as an indirect risk factor in human cancers not all causes are controllable such as naturally occurring background radiation and cancers caused through hereditary genetic disorders and thus are not preventable via personal behavior in of all cancer deaths or m deaths or million lost life years were due to known clearly preventable risk factors led by smoking alcohol use and high bmi according to a gbd systematic analysis dietary while many dietary have been proposed to reduce cancer risks the evidence to support them is not definitive the primary dietary factors that increase risk are obesity and alcohol consumption diets low in fruits and vegetables and high in red meat have been implicated but reviews and metaanalyses do not come to a consistent conclusion a metaanalysis found no relationship between fruits and vegetables and cancer coffee is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer studies have linked excessive consumption of red or processed meat to an increased risk of breast cancer colon cancer and pancreatic cancer a phenomenon that could be due to the presence of carcinogens in meats cooked at high temperatures in the iarc reported that eating processed meat eg bacon ham hot dogs sausages and to a lesser degree red meat was linked to some for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables fruit whole grains and fish and an avoidance of processed and red meat beef pork lamb animal fats pickled foods and refined medication medications can be used to prevent cancer in a few in the general population nsaids reduce the risk of colorectal cancer however due to and side effects they cause overall harm when used for prevention aspirin has been found to reduce the risk of death from cancer by about cox inhibitors may decrease the rate of polyp formation in people with familial adenomatous polyposis however it is associated with the same adverse effects as nsaids daily use of tamoxifen or raloxifene reduce the risk of breast cancer in highrisk women the benefit versus harm for inhibitor such as finasteride is not clearvitamin does not appear to be effective at preventing cancer while low blood levels of vitamin d are correlated with increased cancer risk whether this relationship is causal and vitamin d is protective is not determined one review found that supplements had no significant effect on cancer risk another review concluded that vitamin d may decrease the risk of death from cancer one fewer death in people treated over years but concerns with the quality of the data were increases lung cancer rates in those who are high risk folic acid is not effective in preventing colon cancer and may increase colon polyps selenium has not been shown to reduce the risk of cancer vaccination vaccines have been developed that prevent infection by some carcinogenic viruses human vaccine gardasil and cervarix decrease the risk of developing cervical cancer the hepatitis b vaccine prevents infection with hepatitis b virus and thus decreases the risk of liver cancer the of human and hepatitis b vaccinations is recommended where resources allow screening unlike diagnostic efforts prompted by symptoms and medical signs cancer screening involves efforts to detect cancer after it has formed but before any noticeable symptoms appear this may involve physical examination blood or urine tests or medical screening is not available for many types of cancers even when tests are available they may not be recommended for everyone universal screening or mass screening involves screening everyone selective screening identifies people who are at higher risk such as people with a family history several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening these factors include possible harms from the screening test for example xray images involve exposure to potentially harmful ionizing radiation the likelihood of the test correctly identifying cancer the likelihood that cancer is present screening is not normally useful for rare cancers possible harms from followup procedures whether suitable treatment is available whether early detection improves treatment outcomes whether cancer will ever need treatment whether the test is acceptable to the people if a screening test is too burdensome for example extremely painful then people will refuse to participate cost us preventive services task force the us preventive services task force uspstf issues for various cancers strongly recommends cervical cancer screening in women who are sexually active and have a cervix at least until the age of recommend that americans be screened for colorectal cancer via fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy starting at age until age evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening for skin cancer oral cancer lung cancer or prostate cancer in men under routine screening is not recommended for bladder cancer testicular cancer ovarian cancer pancreatic cancer or prostate cancer recommends mammography for breast cancer screening every two years from ages but does not recommend either breast or clinical breast examination a cochrane review concluded that breast cancer screening by mammography had no effect in reducing mortality because of and japan screens for gastric cancer using due to the high incidence there genetic testing genetic testing for individuals at highrisk of certain cancers is recommended by unofficial groups carriers of these mutations may then undergo enhanced surveillance or preventative surgery to reduce their subsequent risk management many treatment options for cancer exist the primary ones include surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy hormonal therapy targeted therapy and palliative care which treatments are used depends on the type location and grade of the cancer as well as the patients health and preferences the treatment intent may or may not be curative chemotherapy chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with one or more cytotoxic drugs agents as part of a standardized regimen the term encompasses a variety of drugs which are divided into broad categories such as alkylating agents and traditional agents act by killing cells that divide rapidly a critical property of most cancer cells it was found that providing combined cytotoxic drugs is better than a single drug a process called the combination therapy which has an advantage in the statistics of survival and response to the tumor and in the progress of the disease a cochrane review concluded that combined therapy was more effective to treat metastasized breast cancer however generally it is not certain whether combination chemotherapy leads to better health outcomes when both survival and toxicity are therapy is a form of chemotherapy that targets specific molecular differences between cancer and normal cells the first targeted therapies blocked the estrogen receptor molecule inhibiting the growth of breast cancer another common example is the class of bcrabl inhibitors which are used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia cml currently targeted therapies exist for many of the most common cancer types including bladder cancer breast cancer colorectal cancer kidney cancer leukemia liver cancer lung cancer lymphoma pancreatic cancer prostate cancer skin cancer and thyroid cancer as well as other cancer typesthe efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage in combination with surgery chemotherapy has proven useful in cancer types including breast cancer colorectal cancer pancreatic cancer osteogenic sarcoma testicular cancer ovarian cancer and certain lung cancers chemotherapy is curative for some cancers such as some leukemias ineffective in some brain tumors and needless in others such as most nonmelanoma skin cancers the of chemotherapy is often limited by its toxicity to other tissues in the body even when chemotherapy does not provide a permanent cure it may be useful to reduce symptoms such as pain or to reduce the size of an inoperable tumor in the hope that surgery will become possible in the future radiation radiation therapy involves the use of ionizing radiation in an attempt to either cure or improve symptoms it works by damaging the dna of cancerous tissue causing mitotic catastrophe resulting in the death of the cancer cells to spare normal tissues such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor shaped radiation beams are aimed from multiple exposure angles to intersect at the tumor providing a much larger dose there than in the surrounding healthy tissue as with chemotherapy cancers vary in their response to radiation therapy is used in about half of cases the radiation can be either from internal sources or external sources the radiation is most commonly low energy xrays for treating skin cancers while higher energy xrays are used for cancers within the body radiation is typically used in addition to surgery and or chemotherapy for certain types of cancer such as early head and neck cancer it may be used alone for painful bone metastasis it has been found to be effective in about of patients surgery surgery is the primary method of treatment for most isolated solid cancers and may play a role in palliation and prolongation of survival it is typically an important part of definitive diagnosis and staging of tumors as biopsies are usually required in localized cancer surgery typically attempts to remove the entire mass along with in certain cases the lymph nodes in the area for some types of cancer this is sufficient to eliminate the cancer palliative care palliative care is treatment that attempts to help the patient feel better and may be combined with an attempt to treat the cancer palliative care includes action to reduce physical emotional spiritual and psychosocial distress unlike treatment that is aimed at directly killing cancer cells the primary goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life people at all stages of cancer treatment typically receive some kind of palliative care in some cases medical specialty professional recommend that patients and physicians respond to cancer only with palliative care this applies to patients who display low performance status implying limited ability to care for themselves received no benefit from prior treatments are not eligible to participate in any appropriate clinical trial no strong evidence implies that treatment would be care may be confused with hospice and therefore only indicated when people approach end of life like hospice care palliative care attempts to help the patient cope with their immediate needs and to increase comfort unlike hospice care palliative care does not require people to stop treatment aimed at the cancer multiple national medical guidelines recommend early palliative care for patients whose cancer has produced distressing symptoms or who need help coping with their illness in patients first diagnosed with metastatic disease palliative care may be immediately indicated palliative care is indicated for patients with a prognosis of less than months of life even given aggressive treatment a variety of therapies using stimulating or helping the immune system to fight cancer have come into use since approaches include antibodies checkpoint therapy and adoptive cell transfer laser therapy laser therapy uses light to treat cancer by shrinking or destroying tumors or precancerous growths lasers are most commonly used to treat superficial cancers that are on the surface of the body or the lining of internal organs it is used to treat basal cell skin cancer and the very early stages of others like cervical penile vaginal vulvar and nonsmall cell lung cancer it is often combined with other treatments such as surgery chemotherapy or radiation therapy laserinduced interstitial litt or interstitial laser uses lasers to treat some cancers using hyperthermia which uses heat to shrink tumors by damaging or killing cancer cells laser are more precise than surgery and cause less damage pain bleeding swelling and scarring a disadvantage is surgeons must have specialized training it may be more expensive than other treatments alternative medicine and alternative cancer treatments are a diverse group of therapies practices and products that are not part of conventional medicine medicine refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine while alternative medicine refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine most and alternative medicines for cancer have not been studied or tested using conventional techniques such as clinical trials some alternative treatments have been investigated and shown to be ineffective but still continue to be marketed and promoted cancer researcher andrew j vickers stated the label unproven is for such therapies it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been disproven prognosis survival rates vary by cancer type and by the stage at which it is diagnosed ranging from majority survival to complete mortality five years after diagnosis once a cancer has metastasized prognosis normally becomes much worse about half of patients receiving treatment for invasive cancer excluding carcinoma in situ and nonmelanoma skin cancers die from that cancer or its treatment a majority of cancer deaths are due to metastases of the primary is worse in the developing world partly because the types of cancer that are most common there are harder to treat than those associated with developed who survive cancer develop a second primary cancer at about twice the rate of those never diagnosed the increased risk is believed to be due to the random chance of developing any cancer the likelihood of surviving the first cancer the same risk factors that produced the first cancer unwanted side effects of treating the first cancer particularly radiation therapy and better compliance with short or longterm survival depends on many factors the most important are the cancer type and the patients age and overall health those who are frail with other health problems have lower survival rates than otherwise healthy people centenarians are unlikely to survive for five years even if treatment is successful people who report a higher quality of life tend to survive longer people with lower quality of life may be affected by depression and other andor disease progression that both impairs quality and quantity of life additionally patients with worse prognoses may be depressed or report poorer quality of life because they perceive that their condition is likely to be fatal people with cancer have an increased risk of blood clots in their veins which can be the use of blood thinners such as heparin decrease the risk of blood clots but have not been shown to increase survival in people with cancer people who take blood thinners also have an increased risk of extremely rare some forms of cancer even from an advanced stage can heal this phenomenon is known as the spontaneous remission epidemiology estimates are that in million new cases of cancer and million deaths occur globally about of males and of females will get cancer at some point in time while of males and of females will die from itin million cancers were diagnosed excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers and other noninvasive cancers and in nearly million people died cancers account for of deaths the most common as of are lung cancer million deaths colorectal cancer stomach cancer liver cancer and breast cancer this makes invasive cancer the leading cause of death in the developed world and the second leading in the developing world over half of cases occur in the developing worlddeaths from cancer were million in deaths have been increasing primarily due to longer lifespans and lifestyle changes in the developing world the most significant risk factor for developing cancer is age although it is possible for cancer to strike at any age most patients with invasive cancer are over according to cancer researcher robert a weinberg if we lived long enough sooner or later we all would get cancer some of the association between aging and cancer is attributed to errors accumulated in dna over a lifetime and agerelated changes in the endocrine system agings effect on cancer is complicated by factors such as dna damage and inflammation promoting it and factors such as vascular aging and endocrine changes inhibiting itsome slowgrowing cancers are particularly common but often are not fatal autopsy studies in europe and asia showed that up to of people have undiagnosed and apparently harmless thyroid cancer at the time of their deaths and that of men develop prostate cancer by age as these cancers do not cause the patients death identifying them would have represented rather than useful medical care the three most common childhood cancers are leukemia brain tumors and lymphomas in the united states cancer affects about in children rates of childhood cancer increased by per year between and in the united states and by per year between and in europe death from childhood cancer decreased by half between and in the united states history cancer has existed for all of human history the earliest written record regarding cancer is from circa bc in the egyptian edwin smith papyrus and describes breast cancer hippocrates c bc c bc described several kinds of cancer referring to them with the greek word karkinos karkinos crab or crayfish this name comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumor with the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet whence it derives its name galen stated that cancer of the breast is so called because of the fancied resemblance to a crab given by the lateral of the tumor and the adjacent distended veins celsus c bc ad translated karkinos into the latin cancer also meaning crab and recommended surgery as treatment galen nd century ad disagreed with the use of surgery and recommended purgatives instead these largely stood for yearsin the th th and th centuries it became acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death the german professor wilhelm fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct the dutch professor francois de la boe sylvius a follower of descartes believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes and that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer his contemporary nicolaes tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads and concluded that it was physician john hill described tobacco sniffing as the cause of nose cancer in this was followed by the report in by british surgeon percivall pott that chimney sweeps carcinoma a cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps with the widespread use of the microscope in the th century it was discovered that the cancer poison spread from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites metastasis this view of the disease was first formulated by the english surgeon campbell de morgan between and society and culture although many diseases such as heart failure may have a worse prognosis than most cases of cancer cancer is the subject of widespread fear and taboos the euphemism of a long illness to describe cancers leading to death is still commonly used in obituaries rather than naming the disease explicitly reflecting an apparent stigma cancer is also euphemised as the cword macmillan cancer support uses the term to try to lessen the fear around the disease in nigeria one local name for cancer translates into english as the disease that cannot be cured this deep belief that cancer is necessarily a difficult and usually deadly disease is reflected in the systems chosen by society to compile cancer statistics the most common form of skin cancers accounting for about onethird of cancer cases worldwide but very few deathsare excluded from cancer statistics specifically because they are easily treated and almost always cured often in a single short outpatient conceptions of patients rights for people with cancer include a duty to fully disclose the medical situation to the person and the right to engage in shared in a way that respects the persons own values in other cultures other rights and values are preferred for example most african cultures value whole families rather than in parts of africa a diagnosis is commonly made so late that cure is not possible and treatment if available at all would quickly bankrupt the family as a result of these factors african healthcare providers tend to let family members decide whether when and how to disclose the diagnosis and they tend to do so slowly and circuitously as the person shows interest and an ability to cope with the grim news people from asian and south american countries also tend to prefer a slower less candid approach to disclosure than is idealized in the united states and western europe and they believe that sometimes it would be preferable not to be told about a cancer diagnosis in general disclosure of the diagnosis is more common than it was in the th century but full disclosure of the prognosis is not offered to many patients around the worldin the united states and some other cultures cancer is regarded as a disease that must be fought to end the civil insurrection a war on cancer was declared in the us military metaphors are particularly common in descriptions of cancers human effects and they emphasize both the state of the patients health and the need to take immediate decisive actions himself rather than to delay to ignore or to rely entirely on others the military metaphors also help rationalize radical destructive treatmentsin the s a relatively popular alternative cancer treatment in the us was a specialized form of talk therapy based on the idea that cancer was caused by a bad attitude people with a cancer repressed selfloathing and afraid to express their emotionswere believed to have manifested cancer through subconscious desire some said that treatment to change the patients outlook on life would cure the cancer among other effects this belief allowed society to blame the victim for having caused the cancer by wanting it or having prevented its cure by not becoming a sufficiently happy fearless and loving person it also increased patients anxiety as they incorrectly believed that natural emotions of sadness anger or fear shorten their lives the idea was ridiculed by susan sontag who published illness as metaphor while recovering from treatment for breast cancer in although the original idea is now generally regarded as nonsense the idea partly persists in a reduced form with a widespread but incorrect belief that deliberately cultivating a habit of positive thinking will increase survival this notion is particularly strong in breast cancer cultureone idea about why people with cancer are blamed or stigmatized called the justworld hypothesis is that blaming cancer on the patients actions or attitudes allows the blamers to regain a sense of control this is based upon the blamers belief that the world is just and so any dangerous illness like cancer must be a type of punishment for bad choices because in a just world bad things would not happen to good people economic effect the total health care expenditure on cancer in the us was estimated to be billion in even though health care expenditure have increased in absolute terms during recent decades the share of health expenditure devoted to cancer treatment has remained close to between the s and a similar pattern has been observed in europe where about of all health care expenditure are spent on cancer treatment in addition to health care expenditure and financial toxicity cancer causes indirect costs in the form of productivity losses due to sick days permanent incapacity and disability as well as premature death during working age cancer causes also costs for informal care indirect costs and informal care costs are typically estimated to exceed or equal the health care costs of cancer workplace in the united states cancer is included as a protected condition by the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc mainly due to the potential for cancer having effects on workers in the workplace could occur if an employer holds a false belief that a person with cancer is not capable of doing a job properly and may ask for more sick leave than other employees employers may also make hiring or firing decisions based on about cancer disabilities if present the eeoc provides interview guidelines for employers as well as lists of possible solutions for assessing and employees with cancer research because cancer is a class of diseases it is unlikely that there will ever be a single cure for cancer any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases angiogenesis inhibitors were once incorrectly thought to have potential as a silver bullet treatment applicable to many types of cancer angiogenesis inhibitors and other cancer therapeutics are used in combination to reduce cancer morbidity and cancer treatments are studied in clinical trials to compare the proposed treatment to the best existing treatment treatments that succeeded in one cancer type can be tested against other types diagnostic tests are under development to better target the right therapies to the right patients based on their individual research focuses on the following issues agents eg viruses and events eg mutations that cause or facilitate genetic changes in cells destined to become cancer the precise nature of the genetic damage and the genes that are affected by it the consequences of those genetic changes on the biology of the cell both in generating the defining properties of a cancer cell and in facilitating additional genetic events that lead to further progression of the cancerthe improved of molecular biology and cellular biology due to cancer research has led to new treatments for cancer since us president richard nixon declared the war on cancer in since then the country has spent over billion on cancer research including resources from public and private sectors the cancer death rate adjusting for size and age of the population declined by five percent between and competition for financial resources appears to have suppressed the creativity cooperation risktaking and original thinking required to make fundamental discoveries unduly favoring lowrisk research into small incremental advancements over riskier more innovative research other consequences of competition appear to be many studies with dramatic claims whose results cannot be replicated and perverse incentives that encourage grantee institutions to grow without making sufficient investments in their own faculty and which uses convert viruses is being studied in the wake of the covid pandemic there has been a worry that cancer research and treatment are slowing down pregnancy cancer affects in pregnant women the most common cancers found during pregnancy are the same as the most common cancers found in nonpregnant women during childbearing ages breast cancer cervical cancer leukemia lymphoma melanoma ovarian cancer and colorectal a new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy as a result cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average some imaging procedures such as mris magnetic resonance imaging ct scans ultrasounds and mammograms with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy some others such as pet scans are nottreatment is generally the same as for nonpregnant women however radiation and radioactive drugs are normally avoided during pregnancy especially if the fetal dose might exceed cgy in some cases some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy early deliveries are often used to advance the start of treatment surgery is generally safe but pelvic surgeries during the first trimester may cause miscarriage some treatments especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the first trimester increase the risk of birth defects and pregnancy loss spontaneous abortions and abortions are not required and for the most common forms and stages of cancer do not improve the mothers survival in a few instances such as advanced uterine cancer the pregnancy cannot be continued and in others the patient may end the pregnancy so that she can begin aggressive treatments can interfere with the mothers ability to give birth vaginally or to breastfeed cervical cancer may require birth by caesarean section radiation to the breast reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of mastitis also when chemotherapy is given after birth many of the drugs appear in breast milk which could harm the baby other animals veterinary oncology mainly on cats and dogs is a growing specialty in wealthy countries and the major forms of human treatment such as surgery and radiotherapy may be offered the most common types of cancer differ but the cancer burden seems at least as high in pets as in humans animals typically rodents are often used in cancer research and studies of natural cancers in larger animals may benefit research into human canceracross wild animals there is still limited data on cancer nonetheless a study published in explored cancer risk in zoo mammals belonging to species individual demonstrated that cancer is a ubiquitous disease of mammals and it can emerge anywhere along the mammalian phylogeny this research also highlighted that cancer risk is not uniformly distributed along mammals for instance species in the order carnivora are particularly prone to be affected by cancer eg over of clouded leopards bateared foxes and red wolves die of cancer while ungulates especially eventoed ungulates appear to face consistently low cancer risks in nonhumans a few types of cancer have also been described wherein the cancer spreads between animals by transmission of the tumor cells themselves this phenomenon is seen in dogs with stickers sarcoma also known as canine venereal tumor and in tasmanian devils with devil facial tumour disease dftd references further reading external links cancer at curlie on telling cancer patients to have a positive attitude at the atlantic chocolate is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels that is available as a liquid solid or paste either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the olmec civilization thth century bce and the majority of mesoamerican people including the maya and aztecs made chocolate beveragesthe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor after fermentation the seeds are dried cleaned and roasted the shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs which are then ground to cocoa mass chocolate in rough form once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating it is called chocolate liquor the liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components cocoa solids and cocoa butter baking chocolate also called bitter chocolate contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions without any added sugar powdered baking cocoa which contains more fiber than cocoa butter can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate a combination of cocoa solids cocoa butter or added vegetable oils and sugar milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk white chocolate contains cocoa butter sugar and milk but no cocoa solids chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist particularly desserts including cakes pudding mousse chocolate brownies and chocolate chip cookies many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate chocolate bars either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate are eaten as snacks gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes such as eggs hearts coins are traditional on certain western holidays including christmas easter valentines day and hanukkah chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate and in some alcoholic drinks such as creme de cacao although cocoa originated in the americas west african countries particularly cote divoire and ghana are the leading producers of cocoa in the st century accounting for some of the world cocoa supply with some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in west africa child slavery and trafficking associated with the cocoa trade remain major concerns a report argued that attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty absence of schools increasing world cocoa demand more intensive farming of cocoa and continued exploitation of child labor history mesoamerican usage chocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history for example one vessel found at an olmec site on the gulf coast of veracruz mexico dates chocolates preparation by preolmec peoples as early as bc on the pacific coast of chiapas mexico a mokaya site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier to bc the residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink an early ad maya tomb from the site in rio azul had vessels with the maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink which suggests that the maya were drinking chocolate around ad documents in maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes in addition to everyday life the maya grew cacao trees in their backyards and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy bitter drinkby the th century the aztecs had gained control of a large part of mesoamerica and had adopted cocoa into their culture they associated chocolate with quetzalcoatl who according to one legend was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice in contrast to the maya who liked their chocolate warm the aztecs drank it cold seasoning it with a broad variety of additives including the petals of the cymbopetalum tree chili pepper allspice vanilla and honey the aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves as their home in the mexican highlands was unsuitable for it so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire those who lived in areas ruled by the aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed tribute cocoa beans were often used as currency for example the aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beansthe maya and aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood the spanish royal chronicler gonzalo fernandez de oviedo y valdes described a chocolate drink he had seen in nicaragua in mixed with achiote because those people are fond of drinking human blood to make this beverage seem like blood they add a little achiote so that it then turns red and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth and when it is red for having achiote it seems a horrific thing because it seems like blood itself adaptation outside mesoamerica until the th century no european had ever heard of the popular drink from the central american peoples christopher columbus and his son ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on columbuss fourth mission to the americas on august when he and his crew stole a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade spanish conquistador hernan cortes may have been the first european to encounter it as the frothy drink was part of the afterdinner routine of montezuma jose de acosta a spanish jesuit missionary who lived in peru and then mexico in the later th century wrote of its growing influence on the spaniards although bananas are more profitable cocoa is more highly esteemed in mexico cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker which toasted do not taste bad it is so prized among the indians and even among spaniards because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of guatemala it also serves as currency because with five cocoas you can buy one thing with thirty another and with a hundred something else without there being and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them the principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call chocolate which is a crazy thing treasured in that land and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces which certainly takes a lot to put up with anyway it is the prized beverage which the indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands and the spaniards especially spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate this chocolate is said to be made in various forms and temperaments hot cold and lukewarm they are wont to use spices and much chili they also make it into a paste and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs the stomach and colds whatever may be the case in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it while columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to spain chocolate made no impact until spanish friars introduced it to the spanish court after the spanish conquest of the aztecs chocolate was imported to europe there it quickly became a court favorite it was still served as a beverage but the spanish added sugar as well as honey the original sweetener used by the aztecs for chocolate to counteract the natural bitterness vanilla another indigenous american introduction was also a popular additive with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor these spices tended to unsettle the european constitution the encyclopedie states the pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset ones stomach which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as healthy chocolate by chocolate had made its way from spain to austria by pope alexander vii had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks within about a hundred years chocolate established a foothold throughout europe the new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market as between the early s and late s the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual cocoa plantations spread as the english dutch and french colonized and planted with the depletion of mesoamerican workers largely to disease cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and african slaves windpowered and horsedrawn mills were used to speed production augmenting human labor heating the working areas of the tablemill an innovation that emerged in france in also assisted in baker chocolate company which makes bakers chocolate is the oldest producer of chocolate in the united states in dr james baker and john hannon founded the company in boston using cocoa beans from the west indies the pair built their chocolate business which is still in operation solid chocolate despite the drink remaining the traditional form of consumption for a long time solid chocolate was increasingly consumed since the th century tablets facilitating the consumption of chocolate under its solid form have been produced since the early th century cailler and menier are early examples in chocolate is paired with hazelnuts an innovation due to new processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the industrial revolution in dutch chemist coenraad van houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate which reduced its bitterness a few years thereafter in he created a press to remove about half the natural fat cocoa butter from chocolate liquor which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality this innovation introduced the modern era of as dutch cocoa this chocolate was instrumental in the of chocolate to its solid form when in english chocolatier joseph fry discovered a way to make chocolate more easily moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter subsequently his chocolate factory frys of bristol england began chocolate bars frys chocolate cream launched in and they became very popular milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the midth century but in swiss chocolatier daniel peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by henri nestle with the liquor in the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when rudolphe lindt invented the conching nestle several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late th and early th centuries rowntrees of york set up and began producing chocolate in after buying out the tuke family business cadbury of birmingham was boxed chocolates in england by their first easter egg in cadbury created the modern chocolate easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes in milton s hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the worlds columbian exposition in chicago and soon began the career of hersheys chocolates with caramels etymology cocoa pronounced by the olmecs as kakawa dates to bc or earlier the word chocolate entered the english language from spanish in about the word entered spanish from the word chocolatl in nahuatl the language of the aztecs the origin of the nahuatl word is uncertain as it does not appear in any early nahuatl source where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl cocoa water it is possible that the spaniards coined the word perhaps in order to avoid caca a vulgar spanish word for faeces by combining the yucatec mayan word chocol hot with the nahuatl word atl water a widely cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning bitter drink is unsupported the change from x to ch is unexplained as is the l another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl meaning beaten drink which may derive from the word for the frothing stick chicoli other scholars reject all these proposals considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown the term chocolatier for a chocolate confection maker is attested from types several types of chocolate can be pure unsweetened chocolate often called baking chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate which combines chocolate with sugar eating chocolate the traditional types of chocolate are dark milk and white all of them contain cocoa butter which is the ingredient defining the physical properties of chocolate consistency and melting temperature plain or dark chocolate as it name suggests is a form of chocolate that is similar to pure cocoa liquor although is usually made with a slightly higher proportion of cocoa butter it is simply defined by its cocoa percentage in milk chocolate the nonfat cocoa solids are partly or mostly replaced by milk solids in white chocolate they are all replaced by milk solids hence its ivory colorother forms of eating chocolate exist these include raw chocolate made with unroasted beans and ruby chocolate an additional popular form of eating chocolate gianduja is made by nut paste typically hazelnut to the chocolate paste other types other types of chocolate are used in baking and these include baking chocolate often unsweetened couverture chocolate used for coating compound chocolate a lowercost alternative and modeling chocolate modeling chocolate is a chocolate paste made by melting chocolate and combining it with corn syrup glucose syrup or golden syrup production roughly twothirds of the entire worlds cocoa is produced in west africa with sourced from cote divoire where as of child labor is a common practice to obtain the product according to the world cocoa foundation in some million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood as of in the uk most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them to melt mold and package to their own design according to the wcfs report the ivory coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world the two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate covering chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies bars truffles costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called chocolate due to the risk of lower demand for their crops genome the sequencing in of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown degrees north and south of the equator the commercial company mars incorporated and the university of california berkeley are conducting genomic research in to improve the of cacao plants in hot climates cacao varieties chocolate is made from cocoa beans the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree theobroma cacao a small m tall ft tall evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the americas recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout south and central america early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now venezuela the scientific name theobroma means food of the gods the fruit called a cocoa pod is ovoid cm in long and cm in wide ripening yellow to orange and weighing about g lb when ripe cacao trees are small understory trees that need rich welldrained soils they naturally grow within deg of either side of the equator because they need about mm of rainfall a year and temperatures in the range of to degc to degf cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than degc degfthe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo forastero and trinitario processing cocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete or by knocking them off the tree using a stick it is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe because if the pod is unripe the beans will have a low cocoa butter content or low sugar content reducing the ultimate flavor microbial fermentation the beans which are sterile within their pods and their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins to ferment present naturally in the environment ferment the material yeasts produce ethanol lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid in some regions an association between filamentous fungi and bacteria called cocobiota acts to produce metabolites beneficial to human health when consumed the fermentation process which takes up to seven days also produces several flavor precursors that eventually provide the chocolate tasteafter fermentation the beans must be dried to prevent mold growth climate and weather permitting this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days in some growing regions for example tobago the dried beans are then polished for sale by dancing the cocoa spreading the beans onto a floor adding oil or water and shuffling the beans against each other using bare feetthe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate facility the beans are cleaned removing twigs stones and other debris roasted and graded next the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib the nibs are ground and liquefied resulting in pure chocolate liquor the liquor can be further processed into cocoa solids and cocoa butter moist incubation the beans are dried without fermentation the nibs are removed and hydrated in an acidic solution then they are heated for hours and dried again gas spectrometry showed that the incubated chocolate had higher levels of strecker aldehydes and lower levels of pyrazines blending chocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture the basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first are dark chocolate sugar cocoa butter cocoa liquor and sometimes vanilla milk chocolate sugar cocoa butter cocoa liquor milk or milk powder and vanilla white chocolate sugar cocoa butter milk or milk powder and an emulsifying agent such as soy lecithin is added though a few prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain gmofree sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture some are now using pgpr an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel the texture is also heavily influenced by processing specifically conching see below the more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added different develop their own signature blends based on the above formulas but varying proportions of the different constituents are used the finest plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least cocoa both solids and butter whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to highquality white chocolate couverture contains only about cocoa butter producers of highquality smallbatch chocolate argue that mass production produces badquality chocolate some massproduced chocolate contains much less cocoa as low as in many cases and fats other than cocoa butter vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented andor roasted beansin the chocolate association in the united states whose members include hershey nestle and archer daniels midland lobbied the food and drug fda to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes currently the fda does not allow a product to be referred to as chocolate if the product contains any of these the eu a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to vegetable oil and must be labeled as family milk chocolate rather than milk chocolate if it contains to canadian food and drug regulations a chocolate product is a food product that is sourced from at least one cocoa product and contains at least one of the following chocolate bittersweet chocolate semisweet chocolate dark chocolate sweet chocolate milk chocolate or white chocolate a cocoa product is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains cocoa nibs cocoa liquor cocoa mass unsweetened chocolate bitter chocolate chocolate liquor cocoa lowfat cocoa cocoa powder or lowfat cocoa powder conching the penultimate process is called conching a conche is a container filled with metal beads which act as grinders the refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture the conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect typically around mm and reduces rough edges hence the smooth feel in the mouth the length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate highquality chocolate is conched for about hours and lesser grades about four to six hours after the process is complete the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about to degc to degf until final processing tempering the final process is called tempering uncontrolled of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye this causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken the uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process the fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms polymorphous the primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present the six different crystal forms have different properties as a solid piece of chocolate the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance once heated the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases the melting process when the heat is removed the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together allowing the chocolate to solidifythe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower chocolate considered good is about forming as many type v crystals as possible this provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time to accomplish this the temperature is carefully manipulated during the generally the chocolate is first heated to degc degf to melt all six forms of crystals next the chocolate is cooled to about degc degf which will allow crystal types iv and v to form at this temperature the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal seeds which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate the chocolate is then heated to about degc degf to eliminate any type iv crystals leaving just type v after this point any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well the most common variant is introducing already tempered solid seed chocolate the temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency a sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results two classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are working the molten chocolate on a surface such as a stone slab until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal seeds the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature stirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to inoculate the liquid chocolate with crystals this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to seed the molten tempering machines or temperers with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate in particular continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering in general molten chocolate coming in at degc is cooled in heat exchangers to temperates of about degc passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear then warmed slightly to remelt undesirable crystal formations shaping chocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses chocolate bars tablets are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes or other predefined shapes which can then be used for consumption cooking and baking the term is also used for combination bars which are a type of candy bars chocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate usually droplike which are meant for decoration and baking pistoles callets and feves are small coinlike or beanlike pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications also see pistole coin and feve trinket chocolate blocks are large cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing other more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks curls and hollow semispheres storage chocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity ideal storage temperatures are between and degc and degf with a relative humidity of less than if refrigerated or frozen without containment chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface various types of blooming effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding degc degf while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below degc degf or excess humidity to distinguish between different types of bloom one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly and if the bloom disappears it is fat bloom moving chocolate between temperature extremes can result in an oily texture although visually unappealing chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the is generally stored away from other foods as it can absorb different aromas ideally chocolates are packed or wrapped and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature additionally chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper the glossy shine snap aroma texture and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well composition nutrition one hundred grams of milk chocolate supplies calories it is as sugar and as dietary fiber fat and protein table of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid table grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source over of the daily value dv of riboflavin vitamin b and the dietary minerals manganese phosphorus and zinc chocolate is a good source dv of calcium magnesium and iron effects on health chocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents theobromine may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans however daily intake of g cocoa g theobromine by humans has been associated with sweating trembling and severe headache chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and which have effects in humans but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals including dogs and to a study the average lead of cocoa beans is ngg which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food however during cultivation and production chocolate may absorb lead from the environment such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline which is still being used in nigeria reports from indicate that chocolate might be a significant source of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high with dark chocolate containing higher amounts and one g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as of the daily lead oral and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate which may increase the risk of kidney stonesa few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not affect blood pressure chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain diseases or cognitive abilitiesone grams of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has mg of caffeine and a g single serving of dark chocolate has mg of caffeine although a single oz ml serving of coffee may contain mg studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as mg and a dose as low as mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids and alkaloids such as theobromine and caffeine labeling some provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of cocoa or cacao this refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar not just the percentage of cocoa solids the belgian ambao mark indicates that no noncocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate a longstanding dispute between britain on the one hand and belgium and france over british use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products this british style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as that are organic or fair trade certified carry labels accordingly in the united states some large chocolate lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as chocolate in june in response to consumer concern about the proposal the fda reiterated cacao fat as one of the signature of the product will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate industry chocolate prevalent throughout the

practices is for farmers to become part of an agricultural cooperative cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food clothes and school fees one of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers the of fair trade has been

platform for criticism and the development of new ideas and philosophy john henley a clergyman founded an oratory in with the principal purpose of reforming the manner in which such public should be performed he made extensive use of the print industry to advertise the events of his oratory making it an omnipresent part of the london public sphere henley was also instrumental in constructing the space of the debating club he added two platforms to his room in the newport district of london to allow for the staging of debates and structured the entrances to allow for the collection of admission these changes were further implemented when henley moved his enterprise to lincolns inn fields the public was now willing to pay to be entertained and henley exploited this increasing of

dominated by television talk radio sound bites and spin they still offer a rare opportunity for citizens to see and hear the major candidates side by side the format of the presidential debates though defined differently in every election is typically more restrictive than many traditional formats forbidding participants to ask each other questions and restricting discussion of particular topics to short time frames the presidential debates were initially moderated in and by the league of women voters and the commission on presidential debates cpd was established in by the republican and democratic parties the presidential debates primary purpose is to sponsor and produce debates for the united states presidential and candidates in a nonpartisan environment the organization which is a nonprofit nonpartisan corporation sponsored all of the presidential debates in and however in announcing its withdrawal from sponsoring the debates the league of women voters stated that it was withdrawing because the demands of the two campaign would perpetrate a fraud on the american voter in the citizens debate commission was formed in the hope of establishing an independent sponsor for

dogs or this house should raise taxes most topics are usually specific to local australian regions to facilitate participant and audience interesteach of the six speakers three affirmative and three negative speak in succession to each other beginning with the affirmative team the speaking order is as follows first affirmative first negative second affirmative second negative third affirmative and finally third negative the debate is finished with a closing argument by the last speaker from each team points of information an interrupting question or statement more commonly known as pois are used in australian and new zealand secondary school level debating the context in which the australasia style of debate is used varies but in australia and new zealand is mostly used at the primary and secondary school level european square debating this is a parisstyle inspired format with four teams with france the united kingdom germany always represented and then one other major european nation for example russia these nations then confront each other on a policy debate on european issues as parts of two broad coalitions each team is composed of two speakers the prime minister and the foreign secretary the debate starts with the first speaker from france followed by the first speaker of germany the opposite side followed by the second speaker of france and the second speaker of germany the debate continues with the first speaker of the united kingdom followed by the first speaker of russia and it goes on with the respective second speakers each debater speaks for minutes the first and the last minutes are protected time no points of information may be asked during the rest of the speech the speaker may be interrupted by points of information pois from the opposite countries debaters from france and the uk may ask pois to debaters representing germany and russia and vice versa respectively the format forces each debater to develop a winning strategy while respecting the coalition this format was commonly developed by the comparative project and declan mccavanna chairman of the fda and was featuring france the uk germany russia and italy speaking speaking is a style of debate which involves no planning in advance and two teams with a first and second speaker while a majority of judges will allow debaters to cite current events and various statistics the only research permitted is the articles given to the debaters along with the resolution shortly before the debate the debate begins with an affirmative firstspeaker constructive speech followed by a negative then an affirmative and negative constructive speech respectively each of these speeches is six minutes in length and is followed by two minutes of there is then an affirmative and negative firstspeaker rebuttal and a negative and affirmative rebuttal respectively these speeches are each four minutes long no new points can be brought into the debate during the style of debate commonly centers on three main contentions although a team can use more or less in order for the affirmative side to win all of the negative contentions must be defeated and all of the affirmative contentions must be left standing most of the information presented in the debate must be tied in to support one of these contentions or signposted much of speaking is similar to public forum debate and policy debate however speech is considered in more areas especially in the united states as a form of speech which is considered separate from debate or itself a form of debate with several types of events impromptu debating impromptu debating is a relatively informal style of debating when compared to other highly structured formats of debate the topic for the debate is given to the participants between fifteen and twenty minutes before the debate starts the debate format is relatively simple each team member of each side speaks for five minutes alternating sides a tenminute discussion period similar to other formats open time follows and then a fiveminute break comparable to other formats preparation time following the break each team gives a minute debate is often considered to be more akin to public speaking since speeches can be anywhere between standup routines to the reputations of nations depending on the topic given to the contestants contestants will be given a list of abstract topics when the event begins and will create a speech on their chosen topic debating debating is primarily a form of united states high school debate though there is collegiate lincoln douglas debate and is named after the debates it is a oneonone event that applies theories to realworld issues debaters normally alternate sides from round to round as either the affirmative which upholds the resolution or negative which attacks it the resolution which changes bimonthly generally asks whether a certain policy or action conforms to a specific valuethough established as an alternative to policy debate there has been a strong movement to embrace certain techniques that originated in policy debate traditional ld debate attempts to be free of policy debate jargon speeches can range in speed from a pace to well over words per minute this technique of fasttalking is often called spreading and is also prevalent in policy debates mace debating the mace debating style is prominent in britain and ireland at the school level and is composed of two teams of two people debating a motion which one team will propose and the other will oppose each speaker will make a sevenminute speech in the order st proposition st opposition nd proposition nd opposition after the first minute of each speech members of the opposing team may request a point of information poi if the speaker accepts they are permitted to ask a question pois are used to attack a speaker on a weak point or to argue against something the speaker said after all four debaters have spoken the debate will be opened to the floor in which members of the audience will question the teams finally one speaker from each team will speak for minutes in these summary speeches the speaker will answer the questions posed by the floor and opposition before summarizing their own key points the mace format of debate is designed to be and to prepare students for bp debate which it is modeled off mock trial model united nations moot court oxfordstyle debating derived from the oxford union debating society of oxford university oxfordstyle debating is a competitive debate format featuring a sharply assigned motion that is proposed by one side and opposed by another oxfordstyle debates follow a formal structure that begins with audience members casting a predebate vote on the motion that is either for against or undecided each panelist presents a sevenminute opening statement after which the moderator takes questions from the audience with interpanel challenges finally each panelist delivers a twominute closing argument and the audience delivers their second and final vote for comparison against the first a winner is then declared either by the majority or by which team has swayed more audience members between the two votes parisstyle debating in paris debating two teams of five debate a given motion one team will attempt to defend the motion while the other team will attack the motion the debate is judged on the quality of the arguments the strength of the rhetoric the charisma of the speaker the quality of the humor the ability to think on ones feet and teamwork despite this format being specifically used in france debates are commonly held in englishthe first speaker of the proposition prime minister opens the debate followed by the first speaker of the opposition shadow prime minister then the second speaker of the proposition and so on every speaker speaks for minutes after the first minute and before the last minute debaters from the opposite

championship upon this style debating debate is conducted under rules originally derived from british procedure though debate now has several variations including american brazilian british canadian and german forms it features the competition of individuals in a multiperson setting it borrows terms such as government and opposition from the british parliament although the term proposition is sometimes used rather than government when debating in the united debate is practiced worldwide and many variations have been created the premier event in the world of debate is the world universities debating championship this tournament is conducted in the traditional british style of debate debating american in the united states the american debate association is the oldest national debating organization based on the east coast and including the ivy league the more recently founded national debate association npda is now the largest collegiate sponsor debating brazilian the brazilian debate involves a proposition team that will support the motion and an opposition team who will oppose the motion unlike british debate brazilian debate uses the term proposition instead of government since brazil has a government rather than a parliament thus teams can either support or oppose the topic in session on the congress therefore the speakers at the debate are called first member of proposition first member of opposition second member of proposition and so on it is the most used competitive debating style used in brazil it is used at the official competitions of the instituto brasileiro de debates brazilian institute of debates at parli brasil every speaker speaks for minutes with seconds of tolerance after that after the first minute and before the last minute debaters from the opposite team may ask points of information which the speaker may accept or reject as they wish although they are supposed to accept at least one another major difference between the brazilian scene and the worlds is that brazilian tournaments use to present themes weeks before the tournament with the motion only being presented minutes before the debate as usual bp some tournaments such as gv debate and open de natal are changing this too the presence of themes makes some differences in the strategy in comparison to general debate however there is no unique model in brazil because many club debates were created before the creation of parli brazil and not all modified their rules this is the case for example of the ufc debate society in fortaleza sociedade de debates da ufc which was established in in ufrn debate society was created and implemented some changes based on the old clube de debates de natal the model parli brazil only started its activities in with the realization of the i brazilian championship of debates in the city of belo horizonte making the second edition in the city of fortaleza and the third is scheduled to take place in the city of

either introduce a new point or improve upon a previous point made by their opening team in a competitive round the teams are ranked first to fourth with the firstplace team receiving points the second receiving the third receiving and the fourth place receiving no points this is the style used by the world universities debating championship wudc debating canadian the canadian debating style involves one government team and one opposition team on the government side there is the prime minister and the minister of the crown on the opposition side there is the leader of the opposition and the shadow minister the debate is structured with each party speaking in a particular order and for a defined length of time however unlike a style debate another dominant debate style in canada debate involves rules and allows for points of order in very few cases the motion may be squirrelable this means that the assigned motion is not intended to be debated and may even be a quote from a film or a song the government team then squirrels the motion into something debatable by making a series of logical links between the proposed motion and the one they propose to debate this makes the debate similar to a prepared debate for the government team and an impromptu debate for the opposition team in canada debating tournaments may involve a mix of and debate or be entirely one style or the other competitive debating takes place in english french or bilingual style in which of content must be in each language opendebating opd german the offene debatte open debate opd is a german

right hand slowly with the palm held upward and at the same time hold forth their left hand with the palm turned downward holding forth the left hand after clapping symbolizes closing the door to rebirth in samsara the drawing back and upraising of the right hand symbolizes ones will to raise all sentient beings up out of samsara cyclic existence and to establish them in the omniscience of

leisure time spending more time to pursue interests that brought them satisfaction however there was concern that these working people might not use their leisure time in worthwhile pursuits the hope of weaning people away from bad habits by the provision of came to the fore in the s and has rarely waned since initially the bad habits were perceived to be of a sensual and physical nature and the counter attractions or perhaps more accurately alternatives deliberately cultivated rationality and the intellect the book and magazine trade of the day encouraged worthwhile hobbies and pursuits the

music watching television or reading these latter activities bring pleasure but lack the sense of achievement usually associated with a hobby they are usually not structured organized pursuits as most hobbies are the pleasure of a hobby is usually associated with making something of value or achieving something of value such leisure is socially valorized precisely because it produces feelings of

dressmaking and cooking scale modeling is making a replica of a reallife object in a smaller scale and dates back to prehistoric times with small clay dolls and other childrens toys that have been found near known populated areas some of the earliest scale models of residences were found in culture in eastern europe these artifacts were dated to be around bc similar models dating back to the same period were found in ancient egypt india china and mesopotamia sitesat the turn of the industrial age and through the s some families could afford things such as electric trains windup toys typically boats or cars and the increasingly valuable tin toy soldiers scale modeling as we know it today became popular shortly after world war ii before children as well as adults were content in carving and shaping wooden replicas from block wood kits often depicting enemy aircraft to help with in case of an invasionwith the advent of modern plastics the amount of skill required to get the basic shape accurately shown for any given subject was lessened making it easier for people of all ages to begin assembling replicas in varying scales superheroes aero planes boats cars tanks artillery and even figures of soldiers became quite popular subjects to build paint and display although almost any subject can be found in almost any scale there are common scales for such miniatures which remain constant today model engineering refers to building functioning machinery in metal such as internal combustion motors and live steam models or locomotives this is a demanding hobby that requires a multitude of large and expensive tools such as lathes and mills this hobby originated in the united kingdom in the late th century later spreading and flourishing in the midth century due

there was extensive research into the important role that play has in human development while most evident in childhood play continues throughout life for many adults in the form of games hobbies and sport moreover studies of aging and society support the value of hobbies in healthy aging significant achievements there have been many instances where hobbyists and amateurs have achieved significant discoveries and developments these are a small sample amateur astronomers have explored the skies for centuries and there is a long list of notable amateur astronomers who have made major discoveries amateur astronomers alan hale and thomas bopp discovered the comet halebopp a substantial amount of early scientific research came from the amateur activities of the wealthy such as antoine lavoisiers to the science of chemistry and benjamin franklins into electricity open source is a development model using the internet to cooperate on projects it is most notable in the development of software and widely used software which has been developed and maintained by large numbers of people including many homebased amateurs with high level expertise while the general public was not aware of nature

selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is being presented propaganda can be found in a wide variety of different contextsin the th century the english term propaganda was often associated with a manipulative approach but historically propaganda has been a neutral descriptive term of any material that promotes certain opinions or ideologies equivalent nonenglish terms have also largely retained the original neutral connotationa wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages which changed as new technologies were invented including paintings cartoons posters pamphlets films radio shows tv shows and websites more recently the digital age has given rise to new ways of propaganda for example bots and algorithms are currently being used to create propaganda and fake or biased news and spread it on social media etymology propaganda is a modern latin word the neuter plural gerundive form of propagare meaning to spread or to propagate thus propaganda means the things which are to be propagated originally this word derived from a new body of the catholic church congregation created in as part of the called the congregatio de propaganda fide congregation for propagating the faith or informally simply propaganda its activity was aimed at propagating the catholic faith in noncatholic the s the term began being used also to refer to propaganda in secular activities the term began taking a pejorative or negative connotation in the midth century when it was used in the political sphere definition propaganda was as a form of influence designed to build social consensus in the th century the term propaganda emerged along with the rise of mass media including newspapers and radio as researchers began studying the effects of media they used suggestion theory to explain how people could be influenced by persuasive messages harold lasswell provided a broad definition of the term propaganda writing it as the expression of opinions or actions carried out deliberately by individuals or groups with a view to influencing the opinions or actions of other individuals or groups for ends and through garth jowett and victoria odonnell theorize that propaganda and persuasion are linked as humans use as a form of soft power through the development and cultivation of propaganda materials in a literary debate with edward bernays everett dean martin argues that propaganda is making puppets of us we are moved by hidden strings which the propagandist manipulates in the s and s propaganda was sometimes described as allpowerful for example bernays acknowledged in his book propaganda that the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country we are governed our minds are molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of history primitive forms of propaganda have been a human activity as far back as reliable recorded evidence exists the behistun inscription c bce detailing the rise of darius i to the persian throne is viewed by most historians as an early example of propaganda another striking example of propaganda during ancient history is the last roman civil wars bce during which octavian and mark antony blamed each other for obscure and degrading origins cruelty cowardice oratorical and literary incompetence debaucheries luxury drunkenness and other slanders this defamation took the form of uituperatio roman rhetorical genre of the invective which was decisive for shaping the roman public opinion at this time another early example of propaganda was from genghis khan the emperor would send some of his men ahead of his army to spread rumors to the enemy in many cases his army was actually smaller than his opponents holy roman emperor maximilian i was the first ruler to utilize the power of the printing press for propaganda in order to build his image stir up patriotic feelings in the population of his empire he was the first ruler who utilized onesided battle reports the early predecessors of modern newspapers or neue zeitungen targeting the mass and influence the population of his enemies propaganda during the reformation helped by the spread of the printing press throughout europe and in particular within germany caused new ideas thoughts and doctrine to be made available to the public in ways that had never been seen before the th century during the era of the american revolution the american colonies had a flourishing network of newspapers and printers who specialized in the topic on behalf of the patriots and to a lesser extent on behalf of the loyalists academic barbara diggsbrown conceives that the negative connotations of the term propaganda are associated with the earlier social and political that occurred during the french period movement of to between the start and the middle portion of the th century in a time where the word started to be used in a nonclerical and political context the first largescale and organised propagation of government propaganda was occasioned by the outbreak of the first world war in after the defeat of germany military officials such as general erich ludendorff suggested that british propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat adolf hitler came to echo this view believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and revolts in the german home front and navy in see also in mein kampf hitler expounded his theory of propaganda which provided a powerful base for his rise to power in historian robert ensor explains that hitlerputs no limit on what can be done by propaganda people will believe anything provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough and that are either silenced or smothered in calumny this was to be true in germany and backed up with their army making it difficult to allow other propaganda to flow in most propaganda in nazi germany was produced by the ministry of public and propaganda under joseph goebbels goebbels mentions propaganda as a way to see through the masses symbols are used towards propaganda such as justice liberty and ones devotion to ones country world war ii saw continued use of propaganda as a weapon of war building on the experience of wwi by goebbels and the british political warfare executive as well as the united states office of war the early th century the invention of motion pictures as in movies diafilms gave a powerful tool for advancing political and military interests when it came to reaching a broad segment of the population and creating consent or encouraging rejection of the real or imagined enemy in the years following the october revolution of the soviet government sponsored the russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films eg the film the battleship potemkin glorifies communist ideals in wwii nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films to create popular support for occupying the sudetenland and attacking poland the s and s which saw the rise of totalitarian states and the second world war are arguably the golden age of propaganda leni riefenstahl a filmmaker working in nazi germany created one of the bestknown propaganda movies triumph of the will in the propaganda song niet molotoff was made in finland during the continuation war making fun of the red armys failure in the winter war referring the songs name to the soviets minister of foreign affairs vyacheslav molotov in the us animation became popular especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the us war effort eg der fuehrers face which ridicules hitler and advocates the value of freedom some american war films in the early s were designed to create a patriotic mindset and convince viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat the axis powers others were intended to help americans understand their allies in general as in films like know your ally britain and our greek allies apart from its war films hollywood did its part to boost american morale in a film intended to show how stars of stage and screen who remained on the home front were doing their part not just in their labors but also in their that a variety of peoples worked together against the axis menace stage door canteen features one segment meant to dispel americans mistrust of the soviets and another to dispel their bigotry against the chinese polish filmmakers in great britain created the antinazi color film calling mr smith about nazi crimes in europe and about lies of nazi west and the soviet union both used propaganda extensively during the cold war both sides used film television and radio programming to influence their own citizens each other and third world nations through a front organization called the bedford publishing company the cia through a covert department called the office of policy coordination disseminated over million books to soviet readers over the span of years including novels by george orwell albert camus vladimir nabakov james joyce and pasternak in an attempt to promote sentiment and sympathy of western values george orwells novels animal farm and nineteen eightyfour portray the use of propaganda in fictional dystopian societies during the cuban revolution fidel castro stressed the importance of propaganda propaganda was used extensively by communist forces in the vietnam war as means of controlling peoples the yugoslav wars propaganda was used as a military strategy by governments of federal republic of yugoslavia and croatia propaganda was used to create fear and hatred and particularly to incite the serb population against the other ethnicities bosniaks croats albanians and other nonserbs serb media made a great effort in justifying revising or denying mass war crimes committed by serb forces during these wars public perceptions in the early th century the term propaganda was used by the founders of the nascent public relations industry to refer to their people literally translated from the latin gerundive as things that must be disseminated in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation the connotations of the term propaganda can also vary over time for example in portuguese and some spanish language speaking countries particularly in the southern cone the word propaganda usually refers to the most common manipulative media advertising in english propaganda was originally a neutral term for the of information in favor of any given cause during the th century however the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries representing the intentional of often false but certainly compelling claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies according to harold lasswell the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during world war i by the creel committee in the united states and the ministry of information in britain writing in lasswell observed in democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends the outcry in the united states against mr creels famous bureau of public information or inflammation helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed the publics discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate and the have sought protective coloration in such names as public relations council specialist in public education public relations adviser in political science professor dayton david mckean wrote after world war i the word came to be applied to what you dont like of the other fellows publicity as edward l bernays said contestation the term is essentially contested and some have argued for a neutral definition arguing that ethics depend on intent and context while others define it as necessarily unethical and negative emma briant defines it as the deliberate manipulation of including text pictures video speech etc with the intention of producing any effect in the audience eg action or inaction or of feelings ideas attitudes or behaviours that is desired by the propagandist the same author explains the importance of consistent terminology across history particularly as contemporary euphemistic synonyms are used in governments continual efforts to rebrand their operations such as information support and strategic other scholars also see benefits to that propaganda can be interpreted as beneficial or harmful depending on the message sender target audience message and contextdavid goodman argues that the league of nations convention on the use of broadcasting in the cause of peace tried to create the standards for a liberal public sphere the convention encouraged empathetic and neighborly radio broadcasts to other nations it called for league prohibitions on broadcast containing hostile speech and false claims it tried to define the line between liberal and illiberal policies in and emphasized the dangers of nationalist chauvinism with nazi germany and soviet russia active on the radio its liberal goals were ignored while free speech advocates warned that the code represented restraints on free speech types identifying propaganda has always been a problem the main difficulties have involved propaganda from other types of persuasion and avoiding a biased approach richard alan nelson provides a definition of the term propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions attitudes opinions and actions of specified target audiences for ideological political or commercial purposes through the controlled transmission of onesided messages which may or may not be factual via mass and direct media channels the definition focuses on the process involved or more precisely on the purpose of the process and allow propaganda to be interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener propaganda can often be recognized by the rhetorical strategies used in its design in the s the institute for propaganda analysis identified a variety of propaganda techniques that were commonly used in newspapers and on the radio which were the mass media of the time period propaganda techniques include name calling using derogatory labels bandwagon expressing the social appeal of a message or glittering generalities using positive but imprecise language with the rise of the internet and social media renee hobbs identified four design features of many forms of contemporary propaganda it activates strong emotions it simplifies information it appeals to the hopes fears and dreams of a targeted audience and it attacks is sometimes evaluated based on the intention and goals of the individual or institution who created it according to historian zbynek zeman propaganda is defined as either white grey or black white propaganda openly discloses its source and intent grey propaganda has an ambiguous or nondisclosed source or intent black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins compare with black operation a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden in scale these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda for example opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source opposition to grey propaganda when revealed often by an inside source may create some level of public outcry opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported the propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group propaganda in this sense serves as a corollary to censorship in which the same purpose is achieved not by filling peoples minds with approved information but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view what sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change peoples through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and the leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda religious propaganda was often used to influence opinions and beliefs on religious issues particularly during the split between the roman catholic church and the protestant churches or during the crusadesthe sociologist jeffrey k hadden has argued that members of the anticult movement and christian countercult movement accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them hadden argued that exmembers of cults and the anticult movement are committed to making these movements look bad wartime in the war the athenians exploited the figures from stories about troy as well as other mythical images to incite feelings against sparta for example helen of troy was even portrayed as an athenian whose mother nemesis would avenge troy during the punic wars extensive campaigns of propaganda were carried out by both sides to dissolve the roman system of socii and the greek poleis hannibal released without conditions latin prisoners that he had treated generously to their native cities where they helped to disseminate his propaganda the romans on the other hand tried to portray hannibal as a person devoid of humanity and would soon lose the favour of gods at the same time led by qfabius maximus they organized elaborate religious rituals to protect roman moralein the early sixteenth century maximilian i invented one kind of warfare targeting the enemies during his war against venice he attached pamphlets to balloons that his archers would shoot down the content spoke of freedom and equality and provoked the populace to rebel against the tyrants their war ii usage of the word propaganda more typically refers to political or nationalist uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas propaganda is a powerful weapon in war in certain cases it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy either internal or external by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens this can be done by using derogatory or racist terms eg the racist terms jap and gook used during world war ii and the vietnam war respectively avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities the goal of this was to demoralize the opponent into thinking what was being projected was actually true most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice which may be fictitious or may be based on facts eg the sinking of the passenger ship rms lusitania by the german navy in world war i the home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just in these efforts it was difficult to determine the accuracy of how propaganda truly impacted the war in nato doctrine propaganda is defined as information especially of a biased or misleading nature used to promote a political cause or point of view within this perspective the information provided does not need to be necessarily false but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the actor or system that performs it propaganda is also one of the methods used in warfare which may also involve false flag operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation eg the bay of pigs invasion used cia planes painted in cuban air force markings the term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes eg during the first world war the main purpose of british propaganda was to encourage men to join the army and women to work in the countrys industry the propaganda posters were used because radios and tvs were not very common at that time the assumption is that if people believe something false they will constantly be assailed by doubts since these doubts are unpleasant see cognitive dissonance people will be eager to have them extinguished and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power for this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented this process of uses an individuals to selfselect agreeable information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations propaganda may be administered in insidious ways for instance disparaging about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system since few people actually doublecheck what they learn at school such will be repeated by journalists as well as parents thus reinforcing the idea that the item is really a wellknown fact even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an source the is then recycled in the media and in the educational system without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others in the soviet union during the second world war the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by stalin who insisted on a heavyhanded style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic on the other hand the unofficial rumors about german atrocities were well founded and convincing stalin was a georgian who spoke russian with a heavy accent that would not do for a national hero so starting in the s all new visual portraits of stalin were retouched to erase his georgian facial and make him a more generalized soviet hero only his eyes and famous moustache remained unaltered zhores medvedev and roy medvedev say his majestic new image was devised to depict the leader of all times and of all of the covenant on civil and political rights prohibits any propaganda for war as well as any advocacy of national or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to hostility or violence by law naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any enough the covenant specifically is not defining the content of propaganda in simplest terms an act of propaganda if used in a reply to a wartime act is not prohibited advertising propaganda shares techniques with advertising and public relations each of which can be thought of as propaganda that promotes a commercial product or shapes the perception of an organization person or brand for example after claiming victory in the lebanon war hezbollah campaigned for broader popularity among arabs by organizing mass rallies where hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah combined elements of the local dialect with classical arabic to reach audiences outside lebanon banners and billboards were commissioned in of the war along with various merchandise items with hezbollahs logo flag color yellow and images of nasrallah tshirts baseball caps and other war memorabilia were marketed for all ages the uniformity of messaging helped define hezbollahs theory generally holds that news items should be objective giving the reader an accurate background and analysis of the subject at hand on the other hand evolved from the traditional commercial to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news these generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light primarily meant to persuade rather than inform normally they use only subtle propaganda techniques and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial if the reader believes that a paid is in fact a news item the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily believed or internalized such are considered obvious examples of covert propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda which is misleading federal law specifically mandates that any appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid edmund mcgarry illustrates that advertising is more than selling to an audience but a type of propaganda that is trying to persuade the public and not to be balanced in judgement politics propaganda has become more common in political contexts in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments political groups but also often covert interests in the early th century propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans propaganda also has much in common with public information campaigns by governments which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior such as wearing seat belts not smoking not littering and so forth again the emphasis is more political in propaganda propaganda can take the form of leaflets posters tv and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other medium in the case of the united states there is also an important legal imposed by law distinction between advertising a type of overt propaganda and what the government office gao an arm of the united states congress refers to as covert propaganda roderick hindery argues that propaganda exists on the political left and right and in mainstream centrist parties hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking what is or is not propaganda not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda and he argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical devastation itself since and the appearance of greater media fluidity propaganda institutions practices and legal frameworks have been evolving in the us and britain briant shows how this included expansion and integration of the apparatus and details attempts to coordinate the forms of propaganda for foreign and domestic audiences with new efforts in strategic these were subject to contestation within the us government resisted by pentagon public affairs and critiqued by some scholars the national defense act for fiscal year section a amended the us information and educational exchange act of popularly referred to as the smithmundt act and the foreign relations act of allowing for materials produced by the state department and the broadcasting board of governors bbg to be released within us borders for the archivist of the united states the smithmundt act as amended provided that the secretary and the broadcasting board of governors shall make available to the archivist of the united states for domestic distribution motion pictures films videotapes and other material years after the initial of the material abroad nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the department of state or the broadcasting board of governors from engaging in any medium or form of either directly or indirectly because a united states domestic audience is or may be thereby exposed to program material or based on a presumption of such exposure public concerns were raised upon passage due to the relaxation of prohibitions of domestic propaganda in the united statesin the wake of this the internet has become a prolific method of distributing political propaganda benefiting from an evolution in coding called bots software agents or bots can be used for many things including populating social media with automated messages and posts with a range of during the us election a was implemented using bots to direct us voters to russian political news and information sources and to spread politically motivated rumors and false news stories at this point it is considered commonplace contemporary political strategy around the world to implement bots in achieving political goals techniques common media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports government reports historical revision junk science books leaflets movies radio television and posters some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to indoctrinate the target group this may begin with a simple transmission such as a leaflet or dropped from a plane or an generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information via a website hotline radio program etc as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals the strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through and then from information seeker to opinion leader through number of techniques based in social research are used to generate propaganda many of these same techniques can be found under logical fallacies since use arguments that while sometimes convincing are not necessarily valid some time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted that work is important but it is clear that information strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with messages identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread propaganda can also be turned on its makers for example postage stamps have frequently been tools for government advertising such as north koreas extensive issues the presence of stalin on numerous soviet stamps is another example in nazi germany hitler frequently appeared on postage stamps in germany and some of the occupied nations a british program to parody these and other naziinspired stamps involved airdropping them into germany on letters containing antinazi literaturein a scandal broke in which the journalist carole cadwalladr several and the academic dr emma briant revealed advances in digital propaganda techniques showing that online human intelligence techniques used in warfare had been coupled with profiling using illegally obtained social media data for political campaigns in the united states in to aid donald trump by the firm cambridge analytica the company initially denied breaking laws but later admitted breaking uk law the scandal provoking a worldwide debate on acceptable use of data for propaganda and influence models persuasion in social psychology the field of social psychology includes the study of persuasion social can be sociologists or the field includes many theories and approaches to persuasion for example theory points out that people can be persuaded by the credibility expertise and the elaboration likelihood model as well as heuristic models of persuasion suggest that a number of factors eg the degree of interest of the recipient of the influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them nobel prizewinning psychologist herbert a simon won the nobel prize for his theory that people are cognitive misers that is in a society of mass information people are forced to make decisions quickly and often as opposed to logically according to william w biddles article a definition of propaganda the four principles followed in propaganda are rely on emotions never argue cast propaganda into the pattern of we versus an enemy reach groups as well as individuals hide the propagandist as much as possiblemore recently studies from behavioral science have become significant in and planning propaganda campaigns these include for example nudge theory which was used by the obama campaign in then adopted by the uk government behavioural insights team behavioural then became subject to great controversy in after the company cambridge analytica was revealed to have applied them with millions of peoples breached facebook data to encourage them to vote for donald trumphaifeng huang argues that propaganda is not always necessarily about convincing a populace of its message and may actually fail to do this but instead can also function as a means of intimidating the citizenry and signalling the regimes strength and ability to maintain its control and power over society by investing significant resources into propaganda the regime can forewarn its citizens of its strength and deterring them from attempting to challenge it propaganda theory and education during the s educators in the united states and around the world became concerned about the rise of antisemitism and other forms of violent extremism the institute for propaganda analysis was formed to introduce methods of instruction for high school and college students helping learners to recognize and desist propaganda by identifying persuasive techniques this work built upon classical rhetoric and it was informed by suggestion theory and social scientific studies of propaganda and persuasion in the s propaganda theory and education examined the rise of american consumer culture and this work was popularized by vance packard in his book the hidden persuaders european theologian jacques elluls landmark work propaganda the formation of mens attitudes framed propaganda in relation to larger themes about the relationship between humans and technology media messages did not serve to enlighten or inspire he argued they merely overwhelm by arousing emotions and ideas limiting human reasoning and judgement in the s academics recognized that news and journalism could function as propaganda when business and government interests were amplified by mass media the propaganda model is a theory advanced by edward s herman and noam chomsky which argues systemic biases exist in mass media that are shaped by structural economic causes it argues that the way in which commercial media institutions are structured and operate eg through advertising revenue of media ownership or access to sources creates an inherent conflict of interest that make them act as propaganda for powerful political and commercial interests the th century has been by three developments of great political importance the growth of democracy the growth of corporate power and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy first presented in their book consent the political economy of the mass media the propaganda model analyses commercial mass media as businesses that sell a product access to readers and audiences to other businesses advertisers and that benefit from access to information from government and corporate sources to produce their content the theory postulates five general classes of filters that shape the content that is presented in news media ownership of the medium reliance on advertising revenue access to news sources threat of litigation and commercial backlash flak and and fear ideology the first three ownership funding and sourcing are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important although the model was based mainly on the of united states media chomsky and herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic political economic structure and the model has subsequently been applied by other scholars to study media bias in other countriesby the s the topic of propaganda was no longer a part of public education having been relegated to a specialist subject secondary english educators grew fearful of the study of propaganda genres choosing to focus on and reasoning instead of the highly emotional forms of propaganda found in advertising and political campaigns in the european commission funded mind over media a digital learning platform for teaching and learning about contemporary propaganda the study of contemporary propaganda is growing in secondary education where it is seen as a part of language arts and social studies education is a form of propaganda that refers to the act of an individual convincing themself of something no matter how irrational that idea may be self propaganda makes it easier for individuals to justify their own actions as well as the actions of others works oftentimes to lessen the cognitive dissonance felt by individuals when their personal actions or the actions of their government do not line up with their moral beliefs is a type of self deception can have a negative impact on those who perpetuate the beliefs created by using modern propaganda the modern propaganda isbn model is a framework introduced in by jacob m delhagen a data scientist who identified political botnets primarily on twitter used to censor public speech and sway voter outcomes in the us elections the model presented in the book modern propaganda explores the manipulation of digital to influence individuals society and news media the book also delves into the and manipulation of data analytics and patterns to shape news stories the modern propaganda model suggests that propaganda techniques such as the use of bots targeted messaging and data manipulation can be used to control the public discourse and sway political outcomes the model argues that modern technology has created new for propaganda and manipulation and that these techniques are increasingly used in political campaigns and other forms of children of all the potential targets for propaganda children are the most vulnerable because they are the least prepared with the critical reasoning and contextual they need to determine whether a message is a propaganda or not the attention children give their environment during development due to the process of developing their of the world causes them to absorb propaganda also children are highly imitative studies by albert bandura dorothea ross and sheila a ross in the s indicated that to a degree formal education and standardized television programming can be seen as using propaganda for the purpose of the use of propaganda in schools was highly prevalent during the s and s in germany in the form of the hitler youth antisemitic propaganda for children in nazi germany the education system was thoroughly coopted to indoctrinate the german youth with antisemitic ideology from the s on the nazi party targeted german youth as one of their special audience for its propaganda messages schools and texts mirrored what the nazis aimed of instilling in german youth through the use and promotion of racial theory julius streicher the editor of der sturmer headed a publishing house that disseminated antisemitic propaganda picture books in schools during the nazi dictatorship this was accomplished through the national socialist teachers league of which of all german teachers were members in the league encouraged the teaching of racial theory picture books for children such as trust no fox on his green heath and no jew on his oath der giftpilz translated into english as the poisonous mushroom and the were widely circulated over copies of trust no fox were circulated during the late s and contained depictions of jews as devils child molesters and other morally charged figures slogans such as judas the jew betrayed jesus the german to the jews were recited in class during the nuremberg trial trust no fox on his green heath and no jew on his oath and der giftpilz were received as documents in evidence because they

worldviews texts sanctified places prophecies ethics or that generally relate humanity to supernatural and spiritual there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine sacredness faith and a supernatural being or practices may include rituals sermons or veneration of deities or saints sacrifices festivals feasts trances initiations matrimonial and funerary services meditation prayer music art dance or public service religions have sacred histories and narratives which may be preserved in sacred texts symbols and holy places that primarily aim to give life meaning religions may contain symbolic tales that may attempt to explain the origin of life the universe and other phenomena some followers believe these to be true stories both faith and reason have been considered sources of religious beliefsthere are an estimated distinct religions worldwide though nearly all of them have regionally based relatively small followings four islam hinduism and for over of the worlds population and of the world either follows one of those four religions or identifies as nonreligious meaning that the remaining faiths account for only of the population combined the religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion atheists and agnostics although many in the demographic still have various religious beliefs a portion of the population mostly located in africa and asia are members of new religious movements scholars have indicated that global religiosity may be increasing due to religious countries having generally higher birth ratesthe study of religion comprises a wide variety of academic disciplines including theology philosophy of religion comparative religion and social scientific studies theories of religion offer various explanations for its origins and workings including the ontological foundations of religious being and belief etymology and history of concept etymology the term religion comes from both old french and anglonorman s ad and means respect for sense of right moral obligation sanctity what is sacred reverence for the gods it is ultimately derived from the latin word religio according to roman philosopher cicero religio comes from relegere re meaning again lego meaning read where lego is in the sense of go over choose or consider carefully contrarily some modern scholars such as tom harpur and joseph campbell have argued that religio is derived from religare re meaning again ligare bind or connect which was made prominent by st augustine following the given by lactantius in divinae iv the medieval usage alternates with order in designating bonded communities like those of monastic orders we hear of the religion of the golden fleece of a knight of the religion of avys religio in classic antiquity religio broadly meant sense of right moral obligation or duty to anything in the ancient and medieval world the etymological latin root religio was understood as an individual virtue of worship in mundane contexts never as doctrine practice or actual source of knowledge in general religio referred to broad social obligations towards anything including family neighbors rulers and even towards god religio was most often used by the ancient romans not in the context of a relation towards gods but as a range of general emotions which arose from heightened attention in any mundane context such as hesitation caution anxiety or fear as well as feelings of being bound restricted or inhibited the term was also closely related to other terms like scrupulus which meant very precisely and some roman authors related the term superstitio which meant too much fear or anxiety or shame to religio at times when religio came into english around the s as religion it took the meaning of life bound by monastic vows or monastic orders the concept of religion where religious and worldly things were separated was not used before the s the concept of religion was first used in the s to distinguish the domain of the church and the domain of civil authorities the peace of augsburg marks such instance which has been described by christian reussmit as the first step on the road toward a european system of sovereign statesroman general julius caesar used religio to mean obligation of an oath when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors roman naturalist pliny the elder used the term religio to describe the apparent respect given by elephants to the night sky cicero used religio as being related to cultum deorum worship of the gods threskeia in ancient greece the greek term threskeia threskeia was loosely translated into latin as religio in late antiquity threskeia was sparsely used in classical greece but became more frequently used in the writings of josephus in the st century ad it was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others to cultic practices it was often contrasted with the greek word which meant too much fear history of the concept of the religion religion is modern concept the concept was invented recently in the english language and is found texts from the th century due to events such as the splitting of christendom during the protestant reformation and in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with noneuropean languages some argue that regardless of its definition it is not appropriate to apply the term religion to nonwestern cultures while some followers of various faiths rebuke using the word to describe their own belief systemthe concept of religion was formed in the th and th centuries despite the fact that ancient sacred texts like the bible the quran and others did not have a word or even a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written for example there is no precise equivalent of religion in hebrew and judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious national racial or ethnic identities one of its central concepts is halakha meaning the walk or path sometimes translated as law which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life even though the beliefs and traditions of judaism are found in the ancient world ancient jews saw jewish identity as being about an ethnic or national identity and did not entail a compulsory belief system or regulated rituals in the st century ad josephus had used the greek term ioudaismos judaism as an ethnic term and was not linked to modern abstract concepts of religion or a set of beliefs the very concept of judaism was invented by the christian church and it was in the th century that jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to christianity the greek word threskeia which was used by greek writers such as herodotus and josephus is found in the new testament threskeia is sometimes translated as religion in todays translations but the term was understood as generic worship well into the medieval period in the quran the arabic word din is often translated as religion in modern translations but up to the mids translators expressed din as lawthe sanskrit word dharma sometimes translated as religion also means law throughout classical south asia the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions medieval japan at first had a similar union between imperial law and universal or buddha law but these later became independent sources of powerthough traditions sacred texts and practices have existed throughout time most cultures did not align with western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred in the th and th centuries the terms buddhism hinduism taoism confucianism and world religions first entered the english language native americans were also thought of as not having religions and also had no word for religion in their languages either no one as a hindu or buddhist or other similar terms before the s hindu has historically been used as a geographical cultural and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the indian subcontinent throughout its long history japan had no concept of religion since there was no japanese word nor anything close to its meaning but when american warships appeared off the coast of japan in and forced the japanese government to sign treaties demanding among other things freedom of religion the country had to contend with this to the philologist max muller in the th century the root of the english word religion the latin religio was originally used to mean only reverence for god or the gods careful pondering of divine things piety which cicero further derived to mean diligence muller many other cultures around the world including egypt persia and india as having a similar power structure at this point in history what is called ancient religion today they would have only called law definition scholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion there are however two general definition systems the and the modern western the concept of religion originated in the modern era in the west parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition with some giving up on the possibility of a definition others argue that regardless of its definition it is not appropriate to apply it to nonwestern culturesan increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion they observe that the way the concept today is used is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the west or even in the west until after the peace of westphalia the macmillan encyclopedia of religions states the very attempt to define religion to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life is primarily a western concern the attempt is a natural consequence of the western speculative and scientific disposition it is also the product of the dominant western religious mode what is called the climate or more accurately the theistic inheritance from judaism christianity and islam the theistic form of belief in this tradition even when downgraded culturally is formative of the dichotomous western view of religion that is the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else between the creator and his creation between god and man the clifford geertz defined religion as a system of symbols which acts to establish powerful pervasive and longlasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic alluding perhaps to tylors deeper motive geertz remarked that we have very little idea of how in empirical terms this particular miracle is accomplished we just know that it is done annually weekly daily for some people almost hourly and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it the theologian antoine vergote took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency he also emphasized the cultural reality of religion which he defined as the entirety of the linguistic expressions emotions and actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings peter mandaville and paul james intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous of and they define religion as a system of beliefs symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence and in which communion with others and otherness is lived as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends ontologies of time space embodiment and knowing according to the macmillan encyclopedia of religions there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture almost every known culture has a depth dimension in cultural experiences toward some sort of ultimacy and that will provide norms and power for the rest of life when more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of in form completeness and clarity in accordance with the environing culture classical friedrich in the late th century defined religion as das commonly translated as the feeling of absolute contemporary georg wilhelm friedrich hegel disagreed thoroughly defining religion as the divine spirit becoming conscious of himself through the finite spiritedward burnett tylor defined religion in as the belief in spiritual beings he argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or idolatry and so on would exclude many peoples from the category of religious and thus has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them he also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies in his book the varieties of religious experience the psychologist william james defined religion as the feelings acts and experiences of individual men in their solitude so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine by the term divine james meant any object that is godlike whether it be a concrete deity or not to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and emile durkheim in his seminal book the elementary forms of the religious life defined religion as a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things by sacred things he meant things set apart and and practices which unite into one single moral community called a church all those who adhere to them sacred things are not however limited to gods or spirits on the contrary a sacred thing can be a rock a tree a spring a pebble a piece of wood a house in a word anything can be sacred religious beliefs myths dogmas and legends are the that express the nature of these sacred things and the virtues and powers which are attributed to themechoes of james and durkheims definitions are to be found in the writings of for example frederick ferre who defined religion as ones way of valuing most and intensively similarly for the theologian paul tillich faith is the state of being ultimately concerned which is itself religion religion is the substance the ground and the depth of mans spiritual lifewhen religion is seen in terms of sacred divine intensive valuing or ultimate concern then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and criticisms eg those made by richard dawkins do not necessarily disturb its adherents aspects beliefs faith in addition to reason has been considered a source of religious beliefs the interplay between faith and reason and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians the origin of religious belief as such is an open question with possible explanations including awareness of individual death a sense of community and dreams mythology the word myth has several meanings a traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice belief or natural phenomenon a person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence or a metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human beingancient polytheistic religions such as those of greece rome and scandinavia are usually categorized under the heading of mythology religions of peoples or cultures in development are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion the term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and nonreligious people by defining another persons religious stories and beliefs as mythology one implies that they are less real or true than ones own religious stories and beliefs joseph campbell remarked mythology is often thought of as other peoples religions and religion can be defined as mythologyin sociology however the term myth has a meaning there myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true examples include the resurrection of their reallife founder jesus which to christians explains the means by which they are freed from sin is symbolic of the power of life over death and is also said to be a historical event but from a mythological outlook whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant instead the symbolism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is most significant religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic practices the practices of a religion may include rituals sermons or veneration of a deity god or goddess sacrifices festivals feasts trances initiations funerary services matrimonial services meditation prayer religious music religious art sacred dance public service or other aspects of human culture social organisation religions have a societal basis either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants or with an organized clergy and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership academic study a number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion theology comparative religion history of religion evolutionary origin of religions anthropology of religion psychology of religion including neuroscience of religion and evolutionary psychology of religion law and religion and sociology of religion daniel l pals mentions eight classical theories of religion focusing on various aspects of religion animism and magic by eb tylor and jg frazer the approach of sigmund freud and further emile durkheim karl marx max weber mircea eliade ee and clifford stausberg gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion including cognitive and biological approaches theories sociological and theories of religion generally attempt to explain the origin and function of religion these theories define what they present as universal of religious belief and practice origins and development the origin of religion is uncertain there are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices according to john monaghan and peter just many of the great world religions appear to have begun as movements of some sort as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world it seems that the key to longterm successand many movements come and go with little longterm effecthas relatively little to do with the prophets who appear with surprising regularity but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to the movementthe development of religion has taken different forms in different cultures some religions place an emphasis on belief while others emphasize practice some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important some religions claim to be universal believing their laws and cosmology to be binding for everyone while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group in many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as education hospitals the family government and political john monoghan and peter just state that it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant persistent and intolerable one important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune cultural system while religion is difficult to define one standard model of religion used in religious studies courses was proposed by clifford geertz who simply called it a cultural system a critique of geertzs model by talal asad categorized religion as an category richard niebuhrs fivefold of the relationship between christ and culture however indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems though with some interplay social one modern academic theory of religion social says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all spiritual practice and worship follows a model similar to the abrahamic religions as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings among the main proponents of this theory of religion are daniel dubuisson timothy fitzgerald talal asad and jason ananda josephson the social argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from christianity and was then applied to nonwestern cultures cognitive science cognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences the field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines including cognitive psychology evolutionary psychology cognitive anthropology artificial intelligence cognitive neuroscience neurobiology zoology and ethology scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire generate and transmit religious thoughts practices and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities and delusions related to religious content occurs in about of people with while this number varies across cultures this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomena and possible relation to psychotic disorders a number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms although diagnoses are practically impossible episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in content is also common in temporal lobe epilepsy and disorder atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy comparative religion is the branch of the study of religions concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the worlds religions in general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper of the fundamental concerns of religion such as ethics metaphysics and the nature and form of salvation studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more of human beliefs and practices regarding the sacred numinous spiritual and divinein the field of comparative religion a common geographical of the main world religions includes middle eastern religions including and iranian religions indian religions east asian religions african religions american religions oceanic religions and classical hellenistic religions in the th and th centuries the academic practice of comparative religion divided religious belief into defined categories called world religions some academics studying the subject have divided religions into three broad categories world religions a term which refers to religions indigenous religions which refers to smaller or religious groups and new religious movements which refers to recently developed recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy or even calling a given practice religious rather than cultural political or social in nature is limited the current state of study about the nature of suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be from cultural norms ie religions some scholars classify religions as either universal religions that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts such as christianity islam buddhism and jainism while ethnic religions are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts others reject the distinction pointing out that all religious practices whatever their origin are ethnic because they come from a particular culture demographic the five largest religious groups by world population estimated to account for billion people and of the population are christianity islam buddhism hinduism with the relative numbers for buddhism and hinduism dependent on the extent of syncretism and traditional folk religion a global poll in surveyed countries and reported that of the worlds population identified as religious as not religious as convinced atheists and also a decrease in as religious when compared to the average from countries a followup poll in found that of the globe identified as religious as not religious and as convinced atheists on average women are more religious than men some people follow multiple religions or multiple religious principles at the same time regardless of whether or not the religious principles they follow allow for syncretism a pew projection suggests that islam will overtake christianity as the plurality religion by unaffiliated populations are projected to drop even when taking rates into account due to differences in birth have indicated that global religiosity may be increasing due to religious countries having higher birth rates in general specific religions abrahamic abrahamic religions are monotheistic religions which believe they descend from abraham judaism judaism is the oldest abrahamic

theology wicca is a neopagan religion first popularised in by british civil servant gerald gardner involving the worship of a god and goddess related aspects law the study of law and religion is a relatively new field with several thousand scholars involved in law schools and academic departments including political science religion and history since scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal of religious phenomena exponents look at canon law natural law and state law often in a comparative perspective specialists have explored themes in western history regarding christianity and justice and mercy rule and equity and discipline and love common topics of interest include marriage and the family and human rights outside of christianity scholars have looked at law and religion links in the muslim middle east and pagan romestudies have focused on in particular the issue of wearing religious symbols in public such as headscarves that are banned in french schools have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism science science acknowledges reason and empirical evidence and religions include revelation faith and sacredness whilst also and metaphysical explanations with regard to the study of the universe both science and religion are not monolithic timeless or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and culturesthe concepts of science and religion are a recent invention the term religion emerged in the th century in the midst of colonization and and the protestant reformation the term science emerged in the th century out of natural philosophy in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature natural science and the phrase religion and science emerged in the th century due to the reification of both concepts it was in the th century that the terms buddhism hinduism taoism and confucianism first emerged in the ancient and medieval world the etymological latin roots of both science scientia and religion religio were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues never as doctrines practices or actual sources of knowledgein general the scientific method gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop theories through elucidation of facts or evaluation by experiments and thus only answers cosmological questions about the universe that can be observed and measured it develops theories of the world which best fit physically observed evidence all scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement or even rejection in the face of additional evidence scientific theories that have an overwhelming of favorable evidence are often treated as de facto verities in general parlance such as the theories of general relativity and natural selection to explain respectively the mechanisms of gravity and evolution religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world and to explain humanitys place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities in terms of christian theology and ultimate truths people rely on reason experience scripture and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe furthermore religious models and metaphors are also revisable as are scientific religion and science albert einstein states for science can only ascertain what is but not what should be and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary religion on the other hand deals only with evaluations of human thought and action it cannot justifiably speak of facts and between factsnow even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal and dependencies though religion may be that which determine the goals it has nevertheless learned from science in the broadest sense what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up morality many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong these include the triple jems of jainism judaisms halacha islams sharia catholicisms canon law buddhisms eightfold path and good thoughts good words and good deeds concept among and morality are not synonymous while it is an almost automatic assumption in christianity morality can have a secular basis the study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism and inconsistent definitions of religiosity politics impact religion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries notably most countries adopt various aspects of sharia the islamic law some countries even define themselves in religious terms such as the islamic republic of iran the sharia thus affects up to of the global population or billion people who are muslims however religion also affects political decisions in many western countries for instance in the united states of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in god and only more likely christians make up of members of the us congress compared with of the general public as of at the same time while of us adults are religiously unaffiliated only one member of congress kyrsten sinema darizona or of that body claims no religious affiliation in most european countries however religion has a much smaller influence on politics although it used to be much more important for instance samesex marriage and abortion were illegal in many european countries until recently following christian usually catholic doctrine several european leaders are atheists eg frances former president francois hollande or greeces prime minister alexis tsipras in asia the role of religion differs widely between countries for instance india is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics given that hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the muslims and the christians who historically belonged to the lower castes by contrast countries such as china or japan are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics secularism is the of the politics of a society from close with a particular religions values and institutions toward nonreligious values and secular institutions the purpose of this is frequently or protection of the populations religious diversity economics one study has found there is a negative correlation between selfdefined religiosity and the wealth of nations in other words the richer a nation is the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious whatever this word means to them many people identify themselves as part of a religion not irreligion but do not selfidentify as and political economist max weber has argued that protestant christian countries are wealthier because of their protestant work ethic according to a study from christians hold the largest amount of wealth of the total world wealth followed by muslims hindus and jews according to the same study it was found that adherents under the irreligion or other religions hold about of the total global wealth while making up only about of the world population see section on health mayo clinic researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality and physical health mental health quality of life and other health outcomes the authors reported that most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes including greater longevity coping skills and quality of life even during terminal illness and less anxiety depression and suicidethe authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial based on a review of related literature according to academic james w jones several studies have discovered positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevityan analysis of data from the us general social survey whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and wellbeing also suggested that the role of different dimensions of in health is rather more complicated the results suggested that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between and health from one form of to another across or to assume effects are uniform for men and women violence critics such as hector avalos regina schwartz christopher hitchens and richard dawkins have argued that religions are inherently violent and harmful to society by using violence to promote their goals in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders jack david eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent arguing religion and violence are clearly compatible but they are not identical he asserts that violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion and that virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary animal sacrifice some but not all religions practise animal sacrifice the ritual killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a deity it has been banned in india superstition greek and roman pagans who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master the romans called such fear of the gods superstitio ancient greek historian polybius described superstition in ancient rome as an instrumentum regni an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the has been described as the nonrational of cause and effect religion is more complex and is often composed of social institutions and has a moral aspect some religions may include or make use of magical thinking adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition some atheists deists and skeptics regard religious belief as superstition the roman catholic church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of god and as such is a violation of the first of the ten commandments the catechism of the catholic church states that superstition in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion para superstition it says is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes it can even affect the worship we offer the true god eg when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary to attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition cf matthew para agnosticism and atheism the terms atheist lack of belief in any gods and agnostic belief in the of the existence of gods though specifically contrary to theistic eg christian jewish and muslim religious teachings do not by definition mean the opposite of religious there are religions including buddhism taoism and hinduism in fact that classify some of their followers as agnostic atheistic or nontheistic the true opposite of religious is the word irreligious irreligion describes an absence of any religion antireligion describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general interfaith cooperation because religion continues to be recognized in western thought as a universal impulse many religious have aimed to band together in interfaith dialogue cooperation and religious the first major dialogue was the parliament of the worlds religions at the chicago worlds fair which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures the th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic political or even religious conflict with representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many christian communities towards jewsrecent interfaith initiatives include a common word launched in and focused on bringing muslim and christian leaders together the c world dialogue the common ground initiative between islam and buddhism and a united nations sponsored world interfaith harmony week culture culture and religion have usually been seen as closely related paul tillich looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion in his own words religion as ultimate concern is the substance of culture and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself in abbreviation religion is the substance of culture culture is the form of religion such a definitely prevents the of a dualism of religion and culture every religious act not only in organized religion but also in the most intimate movement of the soul is culturally formed ernst troeltsch similarly looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that therefore a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would actually kill it in the same manner that a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it however there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion domenic marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature religious are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural cultural for instance language with its grammar is a cultural element while of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice the same applies to music and the arts criticism criticism of religion is criticism of the ideas the truth or the practice of religion including its political and social implications see also notes references sources further reading wendy ed britannica encyclopedia of world religions britannica isbn eliade mircea ed the

the smallest and thus instrument soprano in the family in regular use the violin typically has four strings some can have five usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes g d a e and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers pizzicato and in specialized cases by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow col legno violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres they are most prominent in the western classical tradition both in ensembles from chamber music to orchestras and as solo instruments violins are also important in many varieties of folk music including country music bluegrass music and in jazz electric violins with solid bodies and pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound the violin has come to be incorporated in many nonwestern music cultures including indian music and iranian music the name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it the violin was first known in thcentury italy with some further occurring in the th and th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection in europe it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in western classical music such as the and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the stradivari guarneri guadagnini and amati families from the th to the th century in brescia and cremona italy and by jacob stainer in austria according to their reputation the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it though this belief is disputed great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers as well as still greater numbers of massproduced commercial trade violins coming from cottage industries in places such as saxony bohemia and mirecourt many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by sears roebuck and co and other mass the components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood violins can be strung with gut perlon or other synthetic or steel strings a person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker one who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker etymology the word violin was first used in english in the s the word violin comes from italian violino a diminutive of viola the term viola comes from the expression for tenor violin in from italian and old provencal viola which came from medieval latin vitula as a term which means stringed instrument perhaps coming from vitula roman goddess of joy or from related latin verb vitularicode lat promoted to code la to cry out in joy or exaltation the related term viola da gamba meaning bass viol is from italian literally a viola for the leg ie to hold between the legs a violin is the modern form of the smaller medieval viola da braccio arm violathe violin is often called a fiddle either when used in a folk music context or even in classical music scenes as an informal nickname for the instrument the word fiddle was first used in english in the late th century the word fiddle comes from fedele fydyll fidel earlier fithele from old english fidele fiddle which is related to old norse fidla middle dutch vedele dutch vedel old high german fidula german fiedel a fiddle all of uncertain origin as to the origin of the word fiddle the usual suggestion based on resemblance in sound and sense is that it is from medieval latin vitula history the earliest stringed instruments were mostly plucked for example the greek lyre twostringed bowed instruments played upright and strung and bowed with horsehair may have originated in the nomadic equestrian cultures of central asia in forms closely resembling the modernday mongolian morin huur and the kazakh kobyz similar and variant types were probably disseminated along eastwest trading routes from asia into the middle east and the byzantine to britannica the direct ancestor of all european bowed instruments is the arabic rebab rbb which developed into the byzantine lyra by the th century and later the european rebec several sources suggest alternative for the violins origins such as northern or western europe the first makers of violins probably borrowed from various developments of the byzantine lyra these included the vielle also known as the fidel or viuola and the lira da braccio the violin in its present form emerged in early thcentury northern italy the earliest pictures of violins albeit with three strings are seen in northern italy around at around the same time as the words violino and vyollon are seen in italian and french documents one of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument including its tuning is from the epitome musical by jambe de fer published in lyon in by this time the violin had already begun to spread throughout europe the violin proved very popular both among street musicians and the nobility the french king charles ix ordered andrea amati to construct violins for him in one of these noble instruments the charles ix is the oldest surviving violin the finest renaissance carved and decorated violin in the world is the gasparo da salo c owned by ferdinand ii archduke of austria and later from by the norwegian virtuoso ole bull who used it for forty years and thousands of concerts for its very powerful and beautiful tone similar to that of a guarneri the messiah or le messie also known as the salabue made by antonio stradivari in remains pristine it is now located in the ashmolean museum of oxfordthe most famous violin makers luthiers between the th century and the th century include the school of brescia beginning in the late th century with liras violettas violas and active in the field of the violin in the first half of the th century the dalla corna family active in brescia and venice the micheli family active in brescia the inverardi family active in brescia the gasparo da salo family active in brescia and salo giovanni paolo maggini student of gasparo da salo active in

venice matteo goffriller known for his celli active in venice pietro guarneri son of giuseppe giovanni battista guarneri and from cremona active in venice domenico montagnana active circa in venice santo serafin active before until in changes occurred in the construction of the violin in the th century particularly in the length and angle of the neck and a heavier bass bar the majority of old instruments have undergone these and hence are in a different state than when they left the hands of their makers doubtless with differences in sound and response but these instruments in their present condition set the standard for perfection in violin and sound and violin makers all over the world try to come as close to this ideal as possible to this day instruments from the socalled golden age of violin making especially those made by stradivari guarneri del gesu and montagnana are the most soughtafter instruments by both collectors and performers the current record amount paid for a stradivari violin is ps million us million at that time when the instrument known as the lady blunt was sold by tarisio auctions in an online auction on june construction and mechanics a violin generally consists of a spruce top the soundboard also known as the top plate table or belly maple ribs and back two endblocks a neck a bridge a soundpost four strings and various fittings optionally including a chinrest which may attach directly over or to the left of the tailpiece a distinctive feature of a violin body is its shape and the arching of its top and back the hourglass shape comprises two upper bouts two lower bouts and two concave cbouts at the waist providing clearance for the bow the voice or sound of a violin depends on its shape the wood it is made from the graduation the thickness profile of both the top and back the varnish that coats its outside surface and the skill of the luthier in doing all of these steps the varnish and especially the wood continue to improve with age making the fixed supply of old wellmade violins built by famous luthiers much soughtafter the majority of glued joints in the instrument use animal hide glue rather than common white glue for a number of reasons hide glue is capable of making a thinner joint than most other glues it is reversible brittle enough to crack with carefully applied force and removable with hot water when disassembly is needed since fresh hide glue sticks to old hide glue more original wood can be preserved when repairing a joint more modern glues must be cleaned off entirely for the new joint to be sound which generally involves scraping off some wood along with the old glue weaker diluted glue is usually used to fasten the top to the ribs and the nut to the fingerboard since common repairs involve removing these parts the purfling running around the edge of the spruce top provides some protection against cracks originating at the edge it also allows the top to flex more of the rib structure paintedon faux purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument the back and ribs are typically made of maple most often with a matching striped figure referred to as flame fiddleback or tiger stripe the neck is usually maple with a flamed figure compatible with that of the ribs and back it carries the fingerboard typically made of ebony but often some other wood stained or painted black on cheaper instruments ebony is the preferred material because of its hardness beauty and superior resistance to wear fingerboards are dressed to a particular transverse curve and have a small lengthwise scoop or concavity slightly more pronounced on the lower strings especially when meant for gut or synthetic strings some old violins and some made to appear old have a grafted scroll evidenced by a glue joint between the pegbox and neck many authentic old instruments have had their necks reset to a slightly increased angle and lengthened by about a centimeter the neck graft allows the original scroll to be kept with a baroque violin when bringing its neck into conformance with modern standards the bridge is a precisely cut piece of maple that forms the lower anchor point of the vibrating length of the strings and transmits the vibration of the strings to the body of the instrument its top curve holds the strings at the proper height from the fingerboard in an arc allowing each to be sounded separately by the bow the sound post or soul post fits precisely inside the instrument between the back and top at a carefully chosen spot near the treble foot of the bridge which it helps support it also influences the modes of vibration of the top and the back of the instrument the tailpiece anchors the strings to the lower bout of the violin by means of the tailgut which loops around an ebony button called the tailpin sometimes confusingly called the endpin like the cellos spike which fits into a tapered hole in the bottom block the e string will often have a fine tuning lever worked by a small screw turned by the fingers fine tuners may also be applied to the other strings especially on a student instrument and are sometimes built into the tailpiece the fine tuners enable the performer to make small changes in the pitch of a string at the scroll end the strings wind around the wooden tuning pegs in the pegbox the tuning pegs are tapered and fit into holes in the peg box the tuning pegs are held in place by the friction of wood on wood strings may be made of metal or less commonly gut or gut wrapped in metal strings usually have a colored silk wrapping at both ends for of the string eg g string d string a string or e string and to provide friction against the pegs the tapered pegs allow friction to be increased or decreased by the player applying appropriate pressure along the axis of the peg while turning it strings strings were first made of sheep gut commonly known as catgut which despite the name did not come from cats or simply gut which was stretched dried and twisted in the early years of the th century strings were made of either gut or steel modern strings may be gut solid steel stranded steel or various synthetic materials such as perlon wound with various metals and sometimes plated with silver most e strings are unwound either plain or plated steel gut strings are not as common as they once were but many performers use them to achieve a specific sound especially in historically informed performance of baroque music strings have a limited lifetime eventually when oil dirt corrosion and rosin accumulate the mass of the string can become uneven along its length apart from obvious things such as the winding of a string coming undone from wear players generally change a string when it no longer plays true with good intonation on the harmonics losing the desired tone brilliance and intonation string longevity depends on string quality and playing intensity pitch range a violin is tuned in fifths in the notes g d a e the lowest note of a violin tuned normally is g or g below middle c c on rare occasions the lowest string may be tuned down by as much as a fourth to d the highest note is less well defined e the e two octaves above the open string which is tuned to e may be considered a practical limit for orchestral violin parts but it is often possible to play higher depending on the length of the fingerboard and the skill of the violinist yet higher notes up to c can be sounded by stopping the string reaching the limit of the fingerboard andor by using artificial harmonics acoustics the arched shape the thickness of the wood and its physical qualities govern the sound of a violin patterns of the node made by sand or glitter sprinkled on the plates with the plate vibrated at certain frequencies called chladni patterns are occasionally used by luthiers to verify their work before assembling the instrument sizes apart from the standard full size violins are also made in socalled fractional sizes of and even these smaller instruments are commonly used by young players whose fingers are not long enough to reach the correct positions on fullsized instruments while related in some sense to the dimensions of the instruments the fractional sizes are not intended to be literal descriptions of relative proportions for example a sized instrument is not the length of a full size instrument the body length not including the neck of a fullsize or violin is mm in smaller in some thcentury models a violins body length is mm in and a size is mm in with the violins closest family member the viola size is specified as body length in inches or centimeters rather than fractional sizes a fullsize viola averages cm in however each individual adult will determine which size of viola to use occasionally an adult with a small frame may use a socalled size violin instead of a fullsize instrument sometimes called a ladys violin these instruments are slightly shorter than a full size violin but tend to be highquality instruments capable of producing a sound comparable to that of fine full size violins string violin sizes may differ from the normal string mezzo violin the instrument which corresponds to the violin in the violin octet is the mezzo violin tuned the same as a violin but with a slightly longer body the strings of the mezzo violin are the same length as those of the standard violin this instrument is not in common use tuning violins are tuned by turning the pegs in the pegbox under the scroll or by adjusting the fine tuner screws at the tailpiece all violins have pegs fine tuners also called fine adjusters are optional most fine tuners consist of a metal screw that moves a lever attached to the string end they permit very small pitch adjustments much more easily than the pegs turning a fine tuner clockwise causes the pitch to become sharper as the string is under more tension and turning it the pitch becomes flatter as the string is under less tension fine tuners on all four of the strings are very helpful when using those with a steel core and some players use them with synthetic strings since modern e strings are steel a fine tuner is nearly always fitted for that string fine tuners are not used with gut strings which are more elastic than steel or strings and do not respond adequately to the very small movements of fine tuners to tune a violin the a string is first tuned to a standard pitch usually a hz when accompanying or playing with a fixedpitch instrument such as a piano or accordion the violin tunes to the note on that instrument rather than to any other tuning reference the oboe is generally the instrument used to tune orchestras where violins are present since its sound is penetrating and can be heard over the other woodwinds the other strings are then tuned against each other in intervals of perfect fifths by bowing them in pairs a minutely higher tuning is sometimes employed for solo playing to give the instrument a brighter sound conversely baroque music is sometimes played using lower tunings to make the violins sound more gentle after tuning the instruments bridge may be examined to ensure that it is standing straight and centered between the inner nicks of the fholes a crooked bridge may affect the sound of an otherwise wellmade violin after extensive playing the tuning pegs and their holes can become worn making the pegs liable to slip under tension this can lead to the pitch of the string dropping somewhat or if the peg becomes completely loose to the string completely losing tension a violin in which the tuning pegs are slipping needs to be repaired by a luthier or violin repairperson peg dope or peg compound used regularly can delay the onset of such wear while allowing the pegs to turn smoothly the tuning gdae is used for most violin music including classical music jazz and folk music other tunings are occasionally employed the g string for example can be tuned up to a the use of nonstandard tunings in classical music is known as scordatura in some folk styles it is called cross tuning one famous example of scordatura in classical music is camille saintsaens danse macabre where the solo violins e string is tuned down to e to impart an eerie dissonance to the composition other examples are the third movement of contrasts by bela bartok where the e string is tuned down to e and the g tuned to a g niccolo paganinis first violin concerto where all four strings are designated to be tuned a semitone higher and the mystery sonatas by biber in which each movement has different scordatura tuning in indian classical music and indian light music the violin is likely to be tuned to dada in the south indian style as there is no concept of absolute pitch in indian classical music musicians can use any convenient tuning to maintain these relative pitch intervals between the strings another prevalent tuning with these intervals is bfbf which corresponds to sapasapa in the indian carnatic classical music style in the north indian hindustani style the tuning is usually pasapasa instead of sapasapa this could correspond to fbfb for instance in iranian classical music and iranian light music the violin ls different tunings in any dastgah the violin is likely to be tuned eaea in dastgahh esfahan or in dastgahe sur is eade and eaee in dastgahe mahur is eada in arabic classical music the a and e strings are lowered by a whole step ie gdgd this is to ease playing arabic maqams especially those containing quarter tones while most violins have four strings there are violins with additional strings some have as many as seven strings seven is generally thought to be the maximum number of strings practical on a bowed string instrument with more than seven strings it would be impossible to play any particular inner string individually with the bow violins with seven strings are very rare the extra strings on such violins typically are lower in pitch than the gstring these strings are usually tuned to c f and b if the instruments playing length or string length from nut to bridge is equal to that of an ordinary fullscale violin ie a bit less than inches cm then it may be properly termed a violin some such instruments are somewhat longer and should be regarded as violas violins with five strings or more are typically used in jazz or folk music some custommade instruments have extra strings which are not bowed but which sound due to the vibrations of the bowed strings bows a violin is usually played using a bow consisting of a stick with a ribbon of horsehair strung between the tip and frog or nut or heel at opposite ends a typical violin bow may be cm in overall and weigh about g oz viola bows may be about mm in shorter and g oz heavier at the frog end a screw adjuster tightens or loosens the hair just forward of the frog a leather thumb cushion called the grip and winding protect the stick and provide a strong grip for the players hand traditional windings are of wire often silver or plated silver silk or baleen whalebone now substituted by alternating strips of tan and black plastic some fiberglass student bows employ a plastic sleeve as grip and winding bow hair comes from the tail of a grey male horse which has white hair some cheaper bows use synthetic fiber solid rosin is rubbed onto the hair to render it slightly sticky when the bow is drawn across a string the friction between them makes the string vibrate traditional materials for the more costly bow sticks include snakewood and brazilwood which is also known as pernambuco wood some recent bow design innovations use carbon fiber codabows for the stick at all levels of inexpensive bows for students are made of less costly timbers or from fiberglass glasser playing posture the violin is played either seated or standing up solo players whether playing alone with a piano or with an orchestra play mostly standing up unless prevented by a physical disability such as in the case of itzhak perlman in contrast in the orchestra and in chamber music it is usually played seated in the s and s some orchestras performing baroque music such as the freiburg baroque orchestra have had all of their violins and violas solo and ensemble perform standing up the standard way of holding the violin is with the left side of the jaw resting on the chinrest of the violin and supported by the left shoulder often assisted by a shoulder rest or a sponge and an elastic band for younger players who struggle with shoulder rests the jaw and the shoulder must hold the violin firmly enough to allow it to remain stable when the left hand goes from a high position a high pitched note far up on the fingerboard to a low one nearer to the pegbox in the indian posture the stability of the violin is guaranteed by its scroll resting on the side of the foot while teachers point out the vital importance of good posture both for the sake of the quality of the playing and to reduce the chance of repetitive strain injury advice as to what good posture is and how to achieve it differs in details however all insist on the importance of a natural relaxed position without tension or rigidity things which are almost universally recommended are keeping the left wrist straight or very nearly so to allow the fingers of the left hand to move freely and to reduce the chance of injury and keeping either shoulder in a natural relaxed position and avoiding raising either of them in an exaggerated manner this like any other unwarranted tension would limit freedom of motion and increase the risk of injury hunching can hamper good playing because it throws the body off balance and makes the shoulders rise another sign that comes from unhealthy tension is pain in the left hand which indicates too much pressure when holding the violin left hand and pitch production the left hand determines the sounding length of the string and thus the pitch of the string by stopping it pressing it against the fingerboard with the fingertips producing different pitches as the violin has no frets to stop the strings as is usual with the guitar the player must know exactly where to place the fingers on the strings to play with good intonation tuning beginning violinists play open strings and the lowest position nearest to the nut students often start with relatively easy keys such as a major and g major students are taught scales and simple melodies through practice of scales and arpeggios and ear training the violinists left hand eventually finds the notes intuitively by muscle memory beginners sometimes rely on tapes placed on the fingerboard for proper left hand finger placement but usually abandon the tapes quickly as they advance another commonly used marking technique uses dots of whiteout on the fingerboard which wear off in a few weeks of regular practice this practice is used sometimes in lieu of adequate eartraining guiding the placement of fingers by eye and not by ear especially in the early stages of learning to play the socalled ringing tones are useful there are nine such notes in first position where a stopped note sounds a unison or octave with another open string causing it to resonate students often use these ringing tones to check the intonation of the stopped note by seeing if it is harmonious with the open string for example when playing the stopped pitch a on the g string the violinist could play the open d string at the same time to check the intonation of the stopped a if the a is in tune the a and the open d string should produce a harmonious perfect fourth violins are tuned in perfect fifths like all the orchestral strings violin viola cello except the double bass which is tuned in perfect fourths each subsequent note is stopped at a pitch the player perceives as the most harmonious when a violinist does not play consistently in either the tempered or the natural just scale but tends on the whole to conform with the pythagorean scale when violinists are playing in a string quartet or a string orchestra the strings typically sweeten their tuning to suit the key they are playing in when playing with an instrument tuned to equal temperament such as a piano skilled violinists adjust their tuning to match the equal temperament of the piano to avoid discordant notes the fingers are numbered index through little finger in music notation such as sheet music and etude books especially in editions of violin music numbers over the notes may indicate which finger to use with or o indicating an open string the chart to the right shows the arrangement of notes reachable in first position not shown on this chart is the way the spacing between note positions becomes closer as the fingers move up in pitch from the nut the bars at the sides of the chart represent the usual for beginners tape placements at st high nd rd and th fingers positions the placement of the left hand on the fingerboard is by positions first position where most beginners start although some methods start in third position is the most commonly used position in string music music composed for beginning youth orchestras is often mostly in first position the lowest note available in this position in standard tuning is an open g the highest note in first position is played with the fourth finger on the estring sounding a b moving the hand up the neck the first finger takes the place of the second finger bringing the player into second position letting the first finger take the place of the third finger brings the player to third position and so on a change of positions with its associated movement of the hand is referred to as a shift and effective shifting maintaining accurate intonation and a smooth legato connected sound is a key element of technique at all levels often a guide finger is used the last finger to play a note in the old position continuously lightly touches the string during the course of the shift to end up on its correct place in the new position in elementary shifting exercises the guide finger is often voiced while gliding up or down the string so the player can establish correct placement by ear outside of these exercises it should rarely be audible unless the performer is consciously applying a portamento effect for expressive reasons in the course of a shift in low positions the thumb of the left hand moves up or down the neck of the instrument so as to remain in the same position relative to the fingers though the movement of the thumb may occur slightly before or slightly after the movement of the fingers in such positions the thumb is often thought of as an anchor whose location defines what position the player is in in very high positions the thumb is unable to move with the fingers as the body of the instrument gets in the way instead the thumb works around the neck of the instrument to sit at the point at which the neck meets the right bout of the body and remains there while the fingers move between the high positions a note played outside of the normal compass of a position without any shift is referred to as an extension for instance in third position on the a string the hand naturally sits with the first finger on d and the fourth on either g or g stretching the first finger back down to a c or the fourth finger up to an a forms an extension extensions are commonly used where one or two notes are slightly out of an otherwise solid position and give the benefit of being less intrusive than a shift or string crossing the lowest position on the violin is referred to as half position in this position the first finger is on a low first position note eg b on the a string and the fourth finger is in a downward extension from its regular position eg d on the a string with the other two fingers placed in between as required as the position of the thumb is typically the same in half position as in first position it is better thought of as a backwards extension of the whole hand than as a genuine position the upper limit of the violins range is largely determined by the skill of the player who may easily play more than two octaves on a single string and four octaves on the instrument as a whole position names are mostly used for the lower positions and in method books and etudes for this reason it is uncommon to hear references to anything higher than seventh position the highest position practically speaking is th position very high positions are a particular technical challenge for two reasons firstly the difference in location of different notes becomes much narrower in high positions making the notes more challenging to locate and in some cases to distinguish by ear secondly the much shorter sounding length of the string in very high positions is a challenge for the right arm and bow in sounding the instrument effectively the finer and more expensive an instrument the better able it is to sustain good tone right to the top of the fingerboard at the highest pitches on the e string all notes except those below the open d can be played on more than one string this is a standard design feature of stringed instruments however it differs from the piano which has only one location for each of its notes for instance the note of open a on the violin can be played as the open a or on the d string in first to fourth positions or even on the g string very high up in sixth to ninth positions each string has a different tone quality because of the different weights thicknesses of the strings and because of the resonances of other open strings for instance the g string is often regarded as having a very full sonorous sound which is particularly appropriate to late romantic music this is often indicated in the music by the marking for example sul g or iv a roman numeral indicating to play on the fourth string by convention the strings are numbered from thinnest highest pitch i to the lowest pitch iv even without an explicit instructions in the score an advanced violinist will use herhis discretion and artistic sensibility to select which string to play specific notes or passages open strings if a string is bowed or plucked without any finger stopping it it is said to be an open string this gives a different sound from a stopped string since the string vibrates more freely at the nut than under a finger further it is impossible to use vibrato fully on an open string though a partial effect can be achieved by stopping a note an octave up on an adjacent string and vibrating that which introduces an element of vibrato into the overtones in the classical tradition violinists will often use a string crossing or shift of position to allow them to avoid the change of timbre introduced by an open string unless indicated by the composer this is particularly true for the open e which is often regarded as having a harsh sound however there are also situations where an open string may be specifically chosen for artistic effect this is seen in classical music which is imitating the drone of an organ j s bach in his partita in e for solo violin achieved this fiddling eg hoedown or where taking steps to avoid the open string is musically for instance in baroque music where shifting position was less common in quick passages of scales or arpeggios an open e string may simply be used for convenience if the note does not have time to ring and develop a harsh timbre in folk music fiddling and other traditional music genres open strings are commonly used for their resonant timbre playing an open string with a stopped note on an adjacent string produces a bagpipelike drone often used by composers in imitation of folk music sometimes the two notes are identical for instance playing a fingered a on the d string against the open a string giving a ringing sort of fiddling sound playing an open string with an identical stopped note can also be called for when more volume is required especially in orchestral playing some classical violin parts have notes for which the composer requests the violinist to play an open string because of the specific sonority created by an open string double stops triple stops chords and drones double stopping is when two separate strings are stopped by the fingers and bowed producing two continuous tones typical intervals include rds ths ths ths and octaves doublestops can be indicated in any position though the widest interval that can be naturally in one position is an octave with the index finger on the lower string and the pinky finger on the higher string nonetheless intervals of tenths or even more are sometimes required to be in advanced repertoire resulting in a stretched lefthand position with the fingers extended the term double stop is often used to encompass sounding an open string alongside a fingered note as well even though only one finger stops the string where three or four simultaneous notes are indicated the violinist will typically split the chord choosing the lower one or two notes to play first before immediately continuing onto the upper one or two notes with the natural resonance of the instrument producing an effect similar to if all four notes had been voiced in some a triple stop is possible where three notes across three strings can be voiced the bow will not naturally strike three strings at once but if there is sufficient bow speed and pressure when the violinist breaks sounds a three note chord the bow hair can be bent temporarily onto three strings allowing each to sound this is accomplished with a heavy stroke typically near the frog and produces a loud and aggressive tone double stops in orchestra are occasionally marked divisi and divided between the players with some division of the musicians playing the lower note and some division playing the higher note double stops and divisi are common in orchestral repertoire when the violins play and another instrument or section plays melodically in some genres of historically informed performance usually of baroque music and earlier neither splitchord nor triplestop chords are thought to be appropriate some violinists will arpeggiate all chords including regular double stops playing all or most notes individually as if they had been written as a slurred figure however with the development of modern violins has become more natural due to the bridge being less curved in some musical styles a sustained open string drone can be played during a passage mainly written on an adjacent string to provide a basic this is more often seen in folk traditions than in classical music vibrato vibrato is a technique of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies subtly in a pulsating rhythm while various parts of the hand or arm may be involved in the motion the result is a movement of the fingertip bringing about a slight change in vibrating string length which causes an undulation in pitch most violinists oscillate below the note or lower in pitch from the actual note when using vibrato since it is believed that perception favors the highest pitch in a varying sound vibrato does little if anything to disguise an outoftune note in other words misapplied vibrato is a poor substitute for good intonation scales and other exercises meant to work on intonation are typically played without vibrato to make the work easier and more effective music students are often taught that unless otherwise marked in music vibrato is assumed however it has to be noted that this is only a trend there is nothing on the sheet music that compels violinists to add vibrato this can be an obstacle to a classically trained violinist wishing to play in a style that uses little or no vibrato at all such as baroque music played in period style and many traditional fiddling styles vibrato can be produced by a proper combination of finger wrist and arm motions one method called hand vibrato or wrist vibrato involves rocking the hand back at the wrist to achieve oscillation in contrast another method arm vibrato modulates the pitch by movement at the elbow a combination of these techniques allows a player to produce a large variety of tonal effects the when and what for and how much of violin vibrato are artistic matters of style and taste with different teachers music schools and styles of music favouring different styles of vibrato for example overdone vibrato may become distracting in acoustic terms the interest that vibrato adds to the sound has to do with the way that the overtone mix or tone color or timbre and the directional pattern of sound projection change with changes in pitch by pointing the sound at different parts of the room in a rhythmic way vibrato adds a shimmer or liveliness to the sound of a wellmade violin vibrato is in a large part left to the discretion of the violinist different types of vibrato will bring different moods to the piece and the varying degrees and styles of vibrato are often that stand out in wellknown violinists vibrato trill a vibratolike motion can sometimes be used to create a fast trill effect to execute this effect the finger above the finger stopping the note is placed very slightly off the string firmly pressed against the finger stopping the string and a vibrato motion is implemented the second finger will lightly touch the string above the lower finger with each oscillation causing the pitch to oscillate in a fashion that sounds like a mix between wide vibrato and a very fast trill this gives a less defined transition between the higher and lower note and is usually implemented by choice this trill technique only works well for semitonal trills or trills in high positions where the distance between notes is lessened as it requires the trilling finger and the finger below it to be touching limiting the distance that can be trilled in very high positions where the trilled distance is less than the width of the finger a vibrato trill may be the only option for trill effects harmonics lightly touching the string with a fingertip at a harmonic node but without fully pressing the string and then plucking or bowing the string creates harmonics instead of the normal tone a higher pitched note sounds each node is at an integer division of the string for example halfway or onethird along the length of the string a responsive instrument will sound numerous possible harmonic nodes along the length of the string harmonics are marked in music either with a little circle above the note that determines the pitch of the harmonic or by note heads there are two types of harmonics natural harmonics and artificial harmonics also known as false harmonics natural harmonics are played on an open string the pitch of the open string when it is plucked or bowed is called the fundamental frequency harmonics are also called overtones or partials they occur at wholenumber multiples of the fundamental which is called the first harmonic the second harmonic is the first overtone the octave above the open string the third harmonic is the second overtone and so on the second harmonic is in the middle of the string and sounds an octave higher than the strings pitch the third harmonic breaks the string into thirds and sounds an octave and a fifth above the fundamental and the fourth harmonic breaks the string into quarters sounding two octaves above the first the sound of the second harmonic is the clearest of them all because it is a common node with all the succeeding evennumbered harmonics th th etc the third and succeeding oddnumbered harmonics are harder to play because they break the string into an odd number of vibrating parts and do not share as many nodes with other harmonics artificial harmonics are more difficult to produce than natural harmonics as they involve both stopping the string and playing a harmonic on the stopped note using the octave frame the normal distance between the first and fourth fingers in any given position with the fourth finger just touching the string a fourth higher than the stopped note produces the fourth harmonic two octaves above the stopped note finger placement and pressure as well as bow speed pressure and sounding point are all essential in getting the desired harmonic to sound and to add to the challenge in passages with different notes played as false harmonics the distance between stopping finger and harmonic finger must constantly change since the spacing between notes changes along the length of the string the harmonic finger can also touch at a major third above the pressed note the fifth harmonic or a fifth higher a third harmonic these harmonics are less commonly used in the case of the major third both the stopped note and touched note must be played slightly sharp otherwise the harmonic does not speak as readily in the case of the fifth the stretch is greater than is comfortable for many violinists in the general repertoire fractions smaller than a sixth are not used however divisions up to an eighth are sometimes used and given a good instrument and a skilled player divisions as small as a twelfth are possible there are a few books dedicated solely to the study of violin harmonics two works are henryk hellers sevenvolume theory of harmonics published by simrock in and michelangelo abbados fivevolume tecnica dei suoni armonici published by ricordi in elaborate passages in artificial harmonics can be found in virtuoso violin literature especially of the th and early th centuries two notable examples of this are an entire section of vittorio montis csardas and a passage towards the middle of the third movement of pyotr ilyich tchaikovskys violin concerto a section of the third movement of paganinis violin concerto no consists of thirds in harmonics when strings are worn dirty and old the harmonics may no longer be accurate in pitch for this reason violinists change their strings regularly right hand and tone color the strings may be sounded by drawing the hair of the bow held by the right hand across them arco or by plucking them pizzicato most often with the right hand in some cases the violinist will pluck strings with the left hand this is done to facilitate transitions from pizzicato to arco playing it is also used in some virtuoso showpieces left hand pizzicato is usually done on open strings pizzicato is used on all of the violin family instruments however the systematic study of advanced pizzicato techniques is most developed in jazz bass a style in which the instrument is almost exclusively plucked the right arm hand and bow and the bow speed are responsible for tone quality rhythm dynamics articulation and most but not all changes in timbre the player draws the bow over the string causing the string to vibrate and produce a sustained tone the bow is a wooden stick with tensioned horsetail hair which has been rosined with a bar of rosin the natural texture of the horsehair and the stickiness of the rosin help the bow to grip the string and thus when the bow is drawn over the string the bow causes the string to sound a pitch bowing can be used to produce long sustained notes or melodies with a string section if the players in a section change their bows at different times a note can seem to be endlessly sustainable as well the bow can be used to play short crisp little notes such as repeated notes scales and arpeggios which provide a propulsive rhythm in many styles of music bowing techniques the most essential part of bowing technique is the bow grip it is usually with the thumb bent in the small area between the frog and the winding of the bow the other fingers are spread somewhat evenly across the top part of the bow the pinky finger is curled with the tip of the finger placed on the wood next to the screw the violin produces louder notes with greater bow speed or more weight on the string the two methods are not equivalent because they produce different timbres pressing down on the string tends to produce a harsher more intense sound one can also achieve a louder sound by placing the bow closer to the bridge the sounding point where the bow intersects the string also influences timbre or tone colour playing close to the bridge sul ponticello gives a more intense sound than usual emphasizing the higher harmonics and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard sul tasto makes for a delicate ethereal sound emphasizing the fundamental frequency shinichi suzuki referred to the sounding point as the kreisler highway one may think of different sounding points as lanes in the highway various methods of attack with the bow produce different there are many bowing techniques that allow for every range of playing style many teachers players and orchestras spend a lot of time developing techniques and creating a unified technique within the group these techniques include legatostyle bowing a smooth connected sustained sound suitable for melodies colle and a variety of bowings which produce shorter notes including ricochet sautille martele spiccato and staccato pizzicato a note marked pizz abbreviation for pizzicato in the written music is to be played by plucking the string with a finger of the right hand rather than by bowing the index finger is most commonly used here sometimes in orchestra parts or virtuoso solo music where the bow hand is occupied or for showoff effect lefthand pizzicato will be indicated by a plus sign below or above the note in lefthand pizzicato two fingers are put on the string one usually the index or middle finger is put on the correct note and the other usually the ring finger or little finger is put above the note the higher finger then plucks the string while the lower one stays on thus producing the correct pitch by increasing the force of the pluck one can increase the volume of the note that the string is producing pizzicato is used in orchestral works and in solo showpieces in orchestral parts violinists often have to make very quick shifts from arco to pizzicato and vice versa col legno a marking of col legno italian for with the wood in the written music calls for striking the strings with the stick of the bow rather than by drawing the hair of the bow across the strings this bowing technique is somewhat rarely used and results in a muted percussive sound the eerie quality of a violin section playing col legno is exploited in some symphonic pieces notably the witches dance of the last movement of berliozs symphonie fantastique saintsaenss symphonic poem danse macabre includes the string section using the col legno technique to imitate the sound of dancing skeletons mars from gustav holsts the planets uses col legno to play a repeated rhythm in time signature benjamin brittens the young persons guide to the orchestra demands its use in the percussion variation dmitri shostakovich uses it in his fourteenth symphony in the movement at the sante jail some violinists however object to this style of playing as it can damage the finish and impair the value of a fine bow but most of such will compromise by using a cheap bow for at least the duration of the passage in question detache a smooth and even stroke during which bow speed and weight are the same from beginning of the stroke to the end martele literally hammered a strongly accented effect produced by releasing each bowstroke forcefully and suddenly martele can be played in any part of the bow it is sometimes indicated in written music by an arrowhead tremolo tremolo is the very rapid repetition typically of a single note but occasionally of multiple notes usually played at the tip of the bow tremolo is marked with three short slanted lines across the stem of the note tremolo is often used as a sound effect in orchestral music particularly in the romantic music era and in opera music mute or sordino attaching a small metal rubber leather or wooden device called a mute or sordino to the bridge of the violin gives a softer more mellow tone with fewer audible overtones the sound of an entire orchestral string section playing with mutes has a hushed quality the mute changes both the loudness and the timbre tone colour of a violin the conventional italian markings for mute usage are con sord or con sordino meaning with mute and senza sord meaning without mute or via sord meaning mute off larger metal rubber or wooden mutes are widely available known as practice mutes or hotel mutes such mutes are generally not used in performance but are used to deaden the sound of the violin in practice areas such as hotel rooms for practicing purposes there is also the mute violin a violin without a sound box some composers have used practice mutes for special effect for example at the end of luciano berios sequenza viii for solo violin musical styles classical music since the baroque era the violin has been one of the most important of all instruments in classical music for several reasons the tone of the violin stands out above other instruments making it appropriate for playing a melody line in the hands of a good player the violin is extremely agile and can execute rapid and difficult sequences of notes violins make up a large part of an orchestra and are usually divided into two sections known as the first and second violins composers often assign the melody to the first violins typically a more difficult part using higher positions in contrast second violins play harmony patterns or the melody an octave lower than the first violins a string quartet similarly has parts for first and second violins as well as a viola part and a bass instrument such as the cello or rarely the double bass jazz the earliest references to jazz performance using the violin as a solo instrument are documented during the first decades of the th century joe venuti one of the first jazz violinists is known for his work with guitarist eddie lang during the s since that time there have been many improvising violinists including stephane grappelli stuff smith eddie south regina carter johnny frigo john blake adam taubitz leroy jenkins and jeanluc ponty while not primarily jazz violinists darol anger and mark oconnor have spent significant parts of their careers playing jazz the swisscuban violinist yilian canizares mixes jazz with cuban musicviolins also appear in ensembles supplying orchestral backgrounds to many jazz recordings indian classical music the indian violin while essentially the same instrument as that used in western music is different in some senses the instrument is tuned so that the iv and iii strings g and d on a westerntuned violin and the ii and i a and e strings are sapa dosol pairs and sound the same but are offset by an octave resembling common scordatura or fiddle crosstunings such as gdgd or aeae the tonic sa do is not fixed but variably tuned to accommodate the vocalist or lead player the way the musician holds the instrument varies from western to indian music in indian music the musician sits on the floor crosslegged with the right foot out in front of them the scroll of the instrument rests on the foot this position is essential to playing well due to the nature of indian music the hand can move all over the fingerboard and there is no set position for the left hand so it is important for the violin to be in a steady unmoving position popular music up through at least the s most types of popular music used bowed string sections they were extensively used in popular music throughout the s and early s with the rise of swing music however from to the string sound was often used to add to the fullness of big band music following the swing era from the late s to the mids strings began to be revived in traditional pop music this trend accelerated in the late s with a significant revival of the use of strings especially in soul music popular motown recordings of the late s and s relied heavily on strings as part of their trademark texture with the rise of created music in the s violins declined in use as synthesized string sounds played by a keyboardist with a synthesizer took their place however while the violin has had very little usage in mainstream rock music it has some history in progressive rock eg electric light orchestra king crimson kansas gentle giant the instrument has a stronger place in modern jazz fusion bands notably the corrs the popularity of crossover music beginning in the last years of the th century has brought the violin back into the popular music arena with both electric and acoustic violins being used by popular bands dave matthews band features violinist boyd tinsley the flock featured violinist jerry goodman who later joined the jazzrock fusion band the mahavishnu orchestra james saul davies who is also a guitarist was enlisted by the band as a violinist the folk metal band ithilien use violin extensively along their discography progressive metal band ne obliviscaris feature a violin player tim charles in their artists such as owen pallett the shondes and andrew bird have also spurred increased interest in the instrument indie bands have often embraced new and unusual arrangements allowing them more freedom to feature the violin than many mainstream musical artists lindsey stirling plays the violin in conjunction with rifts and beatseric stanley improvises on the violin with hip hop elements and instrumental beats the successful indie rock and baroque pop band arcade fire use violins extensively in their arrangements folk music and fiddling like many other instruments used in classical music the violin descends from remote ancestors that were used for folk music following a stage of intensive development in the late renaissance largely in italy the violin had improved in volume tone and agility to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well ultimately spreading very widely sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments have observed its widespread use in europe asia and the americas when played as a folk instrument the violin is usually referred to in english as a fiddle although the term fiddle can be used informally no matter what the genre of music worldwide there are various stringed instruments such as the wheel fiddle and apache fiddle that are also called fiddles fiddle music differs from classical in that the tunes are generally considered dance music and various techniques such as droning shuffling and specific to particular styles are used in many traditions of folk music the tunes are not written but are memorized by successive generations of musicians and passed on in what is known as the oral tradition many oldtime pieces call for crosstuning or using tunings other than standard gdae some players of american styles of folk fiddling such as bluegrass or oldtime have their bridges top edge cut to a slightly flatter curve making techniques such as a double shuffle less taxing on the bow arm as it reduces the range of motion needed for alternating between double stops on different string pairs fiddlers who use solid steel core strings may prefer to use a tailpiece with fine tuners on all four strings instead of the single fine tuner on the e string used by many classical players arabic music as well as the arabic rababah the violin has been used in arabic music electric violins electric violins have a magnetic or pickup that converts string vibration to an electric signal a patch cable or wireless transmitter sends the signal to an amplifier of a pa system electric violins are usually constructed as such but a pickup can be added to a conventional acoustic violin an electric violin with a resonating body that produces sound of the electric elements can be called an violin to be effective as an acoustic violin violins retain much of the resonating body of the violin and often resemble an acoustic violin or fiddle the body may be finished in bright colors and made from alternative materials to wood these violins may need to be hooked up to an instrument amplifier or pa system some types come with a silent option that allows the player to use headphones that are hooked up to the violin the first specially built electric violins date back to and were made by victor pfeil oskar vierling george eisenberg benjamin miessner george beauchamp hugo benioff and fredray kislingbury these violins can be plugged into effect units just like an electric guitar including distortion wahwah pedal and reverb since electric violins do not rely on string tension and resonance to amplify their sound they can have more strings for example fivestringed electric violins are available from several and a seven string electric violin with three lower strings encompassing the cellos range is also available the majority of the first electric violinists were musicians playing jazz fusion eg jeanluc ponty and popular music violin violin is the process of determining the maker and manufacture date of a violin this can be an important process as significant value may be attached to violins made either by specific makers or at specific times and locations analysis on design model wood and varnish texture can be used to authenticate a violin forgery and other methods of fraudulent can be used to inflate the value of an instrument see also notes references bibliography further reading lalitha muthuswamy violin

shares land borders with wales to its west and scotland to its north the irish sea lies northwest and the celtic sea area of the atlantic ocean to the southwest it is separated from continental europe by the north sea to the east and the english channel to the south the country covers fiveeighths of the island of great britain which lies in the north atlantic and includes over smaller islands such as the isles of scilly and the isle of wight the area now called england was first inhabited by modern humans during the upper paleolithic period but takes its name from the angles a germanic tribe deriving its name from the anglia peninsula who settled during the th and th centuries england became a unified state in the th century and has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world since the age of discovery which began during the th centurythe english language the anglican church and english law which collectively served as the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world developed in england and the countrys system of government has been widely adopted by other nations the industrial revolution began in thcentury england transforming its society into the worlds first nation england is also home to the two oldest institutions of higher learning in the world the university of cambridge founded in and the university of oxford founded in both of which are routinely ranked among the most prestigious universities terrain is chiefly low hills and plains especially in the centre and south upland and mountainous terrain is mostly restricted to the north and west including the lake district pennines dartmoor and shropshire hills the capital is london whose greater metropolitan population of million as of represents the united kingdoms largest metropolitan area englands population of million comprises of the population of the united kingdom largely concentrated around london the south east and conurbations in the midlands the north west the north east and yorkshire which each developed as major industrial regions during the th centurythe kingdom of england which after included wales ceased being a separate sovereign state on may when the acts of union put into effect the terms agreed in the treaty of union the previous year resulting in a political union with the kingdom of scotland to create the kingdom of great britain in great britain was united with the kingdom of ireland through another act of union to become the united kingdom of great britain and ireland in the irish free state seceded from the united kingdom leading to the latter being renamed the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland toponymy the name england is derived from the old english name englaland which means land of the angles the angles were one of the germanic tribes that settled in great britain during the early middle ages the angles came from the anglia peninsula in the bay of kiel area presentday german state of of the baltic sea the earliest recorded use of the term as engla londe is in the translation into old english of bedes history of the english people the term was then used in a different sense to the modern one meaning the land inhabited by the english and it included english people in what is now southeast scotland but was then part of the english kingdom of northumbria the anglosaxon chronicle recorded that the domesday book of covered the whole of england meaning the english kingdom but a few years later the chronicle stated that king malcolm iii went out of scotlande into lothian in englaland thus using it in the more ancient sensethe earliest attested reference to the angles occurs in the stcentury work by tacitus germania in which the latin word angliicode lat promoted to code la is used the etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the angeln peninsula an angular shape how and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others such as the saxons came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the germanic people in britain angli saxones or english saxons to distinguish them from continental saxons ealdseaxe of old saxony between the weser and eider rivers in northern germany in scottish gaelic another language which developed on the island of great britain the saxon tribe gave their name to the word for england sasunncode gla promoted to code gd similarly the welsh name for the english language is saesnegcode cym promoted to code cy a romantic name for england is loegria related to the welsh word for england lloegrcode cym promoted to code cy and made popular by its use in arthurian legend albion is also applied to england in a more poetic capacity though its original meaning is the island of britain as a whole history prehistory and antiquity the earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as england was that of homo antecessor dating to years ago the oldest protohuman bones discovered in england date from years ago modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the upper paleolithic period though permanent settlements were only established within the last years after the last ice age only large mammals such as mammoths bison and woolly rhinoceros remained roughly years ago when the ice sheets began to recede humans repopulated the area genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the iberian peninsula the sea level was lower than the present day and britain was connected by land bridge to ireland and eurasia as the seas rose it was separated from ireland years ago and from eurasia two millennia later the beaker culture arrived around bc introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores it was during this time that major neolithic monuments such as stonehenge and avebury were constructed by heating together tin and copper which were in abundance in the area the beaker culture people made bronze and later iron from iron ores the development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better ploughs advancing agriculture for instance with celtic fields as well as the production of more effective the iron age celtic culture deriving from the hallstatt and la tene cultures arrived from central europe brythonic was the spoken language during this time society was tribal according to ptolemys lat promoted to code la there were around tribes in the area earlier divisions are unknown because the britons were not literate like other regions on the edge of the empire britain had long enjoyed trading links with the romans julius caesar of the roman republic attempted to invade twice in bc although largely unsuccessful he managed to set up a client king from the trinovantes the romans invaded britain in ad during the reign of emperor claudius subsequently conquering much of britain and the area was incorporated into the roman empire as britannia province the bestknown of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the catuvellauni led by caratacus later an uprising led by boudica queen of the iceni ended with boudicas suicide following her defeat at the battle of watling street the author of one study of roman britain suggested that from ad to ad the roman invaders killed somewhere between and people from a population of perhaps this era saw a grecoroman culture prevail with the introduction of roman law roman architecture aqueducts sewers many agricultural items and silk in the rd century emperor septimius severus died at eboracum now york where constantine was subsequently proclaimed emperor a century laterthere is debate about when christianity was first introduced it was no later than the th century probably much earlier according to bede missionaries were sent from rome by eleutherius at the request of the chieftain lucius of britain in ad to settle differences as to eastern and western ceremonials which were disturbing the church there are traditions linked to glastonbury claiming an introduction through joseph of arimathea while others claim through lucius of britain by during the decline of the roman empire britain was left exposed by the end of roman rule in britain and the withdrawal of roman army units to defend the frontiers in continental europe and partake in civil wars celtic christian monastic and missionary movements flourished patrick thcentury ireland and in the th century brendan clonfert comgall bangor david wales aiden lindisfarne and columba iona this period of christianity was influenced by ancient celtic culture in its polity practices and theology local were centred in the monastic community and monastic leaders were more like chieftains as peers rather than in the more hierarchical system of the church middle ages roman military withdrawals left britain open to invasion by pagan seafaring warriors from northwestern continental europe chiefly the saxons angles jutes and frisians who had long raided the coasts of the roman province these groups then began to settle in increasing numbers over the course of the fifth and sixth centuries initially in the eastern part of the country their advance was contained for some decades after the britons victory at the battle of mount badon but subsequently resumed overrunning the fertile lowlands of britain and reducing the area under brittonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the th century contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce giving rise to its description as a dark age the nature and progression of the anglosaxon settlement of britain is consequently subject to considerable disagreement the emerging consensus is that it occurred on a large scale in the south and east but was less substantial to the north and west where celtic languages continued to be spoken even in areas under anglosaxon control christianity had in general been replaced in the conquered territories by anglosaxon paganism but was reintroduced by missionaries from rome led by augustine from onwards disputes between the roman and forms of christianity ended in victory for the roman tradition at the council of whitby which was ostensibly about tonsures clerical haircuts and the date of easter but more about the differences in roman and celtic forms of authority theology and the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories but by the th century when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including northumbria mercia wessex east anglia essex kent and sussex over the following centuries this process of political continued the th century saw a struggle for hegemony between northumbria and mercia which in the th century gave way to mercian preeminence in the early th century mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by wessex later in that century escalating attacks by the danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of england overthrowing the kingdoms of northumbria mercia and east anglia wessex under alfred the great was left as the only surviving english kingdom and under his successors it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the danelaw this brought about the political unification of england first accomplished under aethelstan in and definitively established after further conflicts by eadred in a fresh wave of scandinavian attacks from the late th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by sweyn forkbeard in and again by his son cnut in turning it into the centre of a shortlived north sea empire that also included denmark and norway however the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of edward the confessor in a dispute over the succession to edward led to the norman conquest in accomplished by an army led by duke william of normandy the normans themselves originated from scandinavia and had settled in normandy in the late th and early th centuries this conquest led to the almost total of the english elite and its replacement by a new aristocracy whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the english the house of plantagenet from anjou inherited the english throne under henry ii adding england to the budding angevin empire of fiefs the family had inherited in france including aquitaine they reigned for three centuries some noted monarchs being richard i edward i edward iii and henry v the period saw changes in trade and legislation including the signing of the magna carta an english legal charter used to limit the sovereigns powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen catholic monasticism flourished providing philosophers and the universities of oxford and cambridge were founded with royal patronage the principality of wales became a plantagenet fief during the th century and the lordship of ireland was given to the english monarchy by the pope during the th century the plantagenets and the house of valois both claimed to be legitimate claimants to the house of capet and with it france the two powers clashed in the hundred years war the black death epidemic hit england starting in it eventually killed up to half of englands inhabitants from to civil war occurred between two branches of the royal family the yorkists and lancastrians known as the wars of the roses eventually it led to the yorkists losing the throne entirely to a welsh noble family the tudors a branch of the lancastrians headed by henry tudor who invaded with welsh and breton mercenaries gaining victory at the battle of bosworth field where the yorkist king richard iii was killed early modern during the tudor period the renaissance reached england through italian courtiers who reintroduced artistic educational and scholarly debate from classical antiquity england began to develop naval skills and exploration to the west intensified henry viii broke from communion with the catholic church over issues relating to his divorce under the acts of supremacy in which proclaimed the monarch head of the church of england in contrast with much of european the roots of the split were more political than theological he also legally incorporated his ancestral land wales into the kingdom of england with the acts there were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of henrys daughters mary i and elizabeth i the former took the country back to catholicism while the latter broke from it again forcefully asserting the supremacy of anglicanism the elizabethan era is the epoch in the tudor age of the reign of queen elizabeth i the virgin queen historians often depict it as the golden age in english history elizabethan england represented the apogee of the english renaissance and saw the flowering of art poetry music and literature the era is most famous for its drama theatre and playwrights england during this period had a centralised and effective government as a result of vast tudor with spain the first english colony in the americas was founded in by explorer walter raleigh in virginia and named roanoke the roanoke colony failed and is known as the lost colony after it was found abandoned on the return of the latearriving supply ship with the east india company england also competed with the dutch and french in the east during the elizabethan period england was at war with spain an armada sailed from spain in as part of a wider plan to invade england and reestablish a catholic monarchy the plan was thwarted by bad coordination stormy weather and successful harrying attacks by an english fleet under lord howard of effingham this failure did not end the threat spain launched two further armadas in and but both were driven back by storms union with scotland the political structure of the island changed in when the king of scots james vi a kingdom which had been a longtime rival to english interests inherited the throne of england as james i thereby creating a personal union he styled himself king of great britain although this had no basis in english law under the auspices of james vi and i the authorised king james version of the holy bible was published in it was the standard version of the bible read by most protestant christians for four hundred years until modern revisions were produced in the th century based on conflicting political religious and social positions the english civil war was fought between the supporters of parliament and those of king charles i known colloquially as roundheads and cavaliers respectively this was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted wars of the three kingdoms involving scotland and ireland the were victorious charles i was executed and the kingdom replaced by the commonwealth leader of the parliament forces oliver cromwell declared himself lord protector in a period of personal rule followed after cromwells death and the resignation of his son richard as lord protector charles ii was invited to return as monarch in in a move called the restoration with the reopening of theatres fine arts literature and performing arts flourished throughout the restoration of the merry monarch charles ii after the glorious revolution of it was established that king and parliament should rule together though parliament would have the real power this was established with the bill of rights in among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by parliament and could not be suspended by the king also that the king could not impose taxes or raise an army without the prior approval of parliament also since that time no british monarch has entered the house of commons when it is sitting which is annually commemorated at the state opening of parliament by the british monarch when the doors of the house of commons are slammed in the face of the monarchs messenger symbolising the rights of parliament and its independence from the monarch with the founding of the royal society in science was greatly encouraged in the great fire of london gutted the city of london but it was rebuilt shortly afterwards with many significant buildings designed by christopher wren in parliament two factions had emerged the tories and whigs though the tories initially supported catholic king james ii some of them along with the whigs during the revolution of invited dutch prince william of orange to defeat james and ultimately to become william iii of england some english people especially in the north were jacobites and continued to support james and his sons under the stuart dynasty england expanded in trade finance and prosperity britain developed europes largest merchant fleet after the parliaments of england and scotland agreed the two countries joined in political union to create the kingdom of great britain in to accommodate the union institutions such as the law and national churches of each remained separate late modern and contemporary under the newly formed kingdom of great britain output from the royal society and other english initiatives combined with the scottish to create innovations in science and engineering while the enormous growth in british overseas trade protected by the royal navy paved the way for the of the british empire domestically it drove the industrial revolution a period of profound change in the and cultural conditions of england resulting in agriculture manufacture engineering and mining as well as new and pioneering road rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development the opening of northwest englands bridgewater canal in ushered in the canal age in britain in the worlds first permanent steam passenger railway the stockton and darlington railway opened to the public during the industrial revolution many workers moved from englands countryside to new and expanding urban industrial areas to work in factories for instance at birmingham and manchester dubbed workshop of the world and warehouse city respectively manchester was the worlds first industrial city england maintained relative stability throughout the french revolution william pitt the younger was british prime minister for the reign of george iii the regency of george iv is noted for its elegance and achievements in the fine arts and architecture during the napoleonic wars napoleon planned to invade from the southeast however this failed to manifest and the napoleonic forces were defeated by the british at sea by horatio nelson and on land by arthur wellesley the major victory at the battle of trafalgar confirmed the naval supremacy britain had established during the course of the eighteenth century the napoleonic wars fostered a concept of britishness and a united national british people shared with the english scots and welsh london became the largest and most populous metropolitan area in the world during the victorian era and trade within the british empire as well as the standing of the british military and navy was prestigious this era saw many innovations that proved key to the united kingdoms power and prosperity political agitation at home from radicals such as the chartists and the suffragettes enabled legislative reform and universal suffrage samuel hynes described the edwardian era as a leisurely time when women wore picture hats and did not vote when the rich were not ashamed to live and the sun really never set on the british flagpower shifts in eastcentral europe led to world war i hundreds of thousands of english soldiers died fighting for the united kingdom as part of the allies two decades later in world war ii the united kingdom was again one of the allies at the end of the phoney war winston churchill became the wartime prime minister developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by airraids during the blitz following the war the british empire experienced rapid and there was a speedingup of innovations automobiles became the primary means of transport and frank whittles development of the jet engine led to wider air travel residential patterns were altered in england by private motoring and by the creation of the national health service nhs in the uks nhs provided publicly funded health care to all uk permanent residents free at the point of need being paid for from general taxation combined these prompted the reform of local government in england in the midth centurysince the th century there has been significant population movement to england mostly from other parts of the british isles but also from the commonwealth particularly the indian subcontinent since the s there has been a large move away from and an increasing emphasis on the service industry as part of the united kingdom the area joined a common market initiative called the european economic community which became the european union since the late th century the of the united kingdom has moved towards devolved governance in scotland wales and northern ireland england and wales continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the united kingdom devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more identity and patriotism there is no devolved english government but an attempt to create a similar system on a subregional basis was rejected by referendum governance politics england is part of the united kingdom a monarchy with a system there has not been a government of england since when the acts of union putting into effect the terms of the treaty of union joined england and scotland to form the kingdom of great britain before the union england was ruled by its monarch and the parliament of england today england is governed directly by the parliament of the united kingdom although other countries of the united kingdom have devolved governments in the house of commons which is the lower house of the british parliament based at the palace of westminster there are members of parliament mps for in england out of the total as of the united kingdom general election england is represented by mps from the conservative party from the labour party seven from the liberal democrats one from the green party and the speaker of the house lindsay hoyle since devolution in which other countries of the united kingdom scotland wales and northern ireland each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues there has been debate about how to this in england originally it was planned that various regions of england would be devolved but following the proposals rejection by the north east in a referendum this has not been carried outone major issue is the west lothian question in which mps from scotland and wales are able to vote on legislation affecting only england while english mps have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters this when placed in the context of england being the only country of the united kingdom not to have free and free topup university fees has led to a steady rise in english nationalism some have suggested the creation of a devolved english parliament while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects england to english mps law the english law legal system developed over the centuries is the basis of common law legal systems used in most commonwealth countries and the united states except louisiana despite now being part of the united kingdom the legal system of the courts of england and wales continued under the treaty of union as a separate legal system from the one used in scotland the general essence of english law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent stare decisis to the facts before themthe court system is headed by the senior courts of england and wales consisting of the court of appeal the high court of justice for civil cases and the crown court for criminal cases the supreme court of the united kingdom is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in england and wales it was created in after changes taking over the judicial functions of the house of lords a decision of the supreme court is binding on every other court in the hierarchy which must follow its secretary of state for justice is the minister responsible to parliament for the judiciary the court system and prisons and probation in england crime increased between and but fell by in the period the prison population doubled over the same period giving it one of the highest rates in western europe at per his majestys prison service reporting to the ministry of justice manages most prisons housing prisoners in england and wales as of september subdivisions the subdivisions of england consist of up to four levels of subnational division controlled through a variety of types of entities created for the purposes of local government outside the london region englands highest tier is the ceremonial counties these are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference and developed gradually since the middle ages these were reformed to in and to its current number in each has a lord lieutenant and high sheriff these posts are used to represent the british monarch locally some counties such as are only divided any further into civil parishes the royal county and berkshire and the metropolitan counties different types of status to other ceremonial counties the second tier is combined authorities and the countytier shire counties in all ceremonial counties were two tier and with the metropolitan countytier phased out the reform separated the ceremonial county and countytier england is also divided into local government districts the district can align to a ceremonial county be a districttier under the countytier shire counties be a royal or metropolitan borough have borough or city status or have unitary authority at the community level much of england is divided into civil parishes with councils in greater london only one queens park exists as of after they were abolished in until legislation allowed their recreation in london from until the early s england was divided into regions a referendum for the london region created the london assembly two years later a failed north east england devolution referendum cancelled further regional assembly devolution with the regional structure outside london abolished ceremonially the region is divided between the city of london and greater london this is further divided into the london boroughs and the wards of the city of london geography landscape and rivers england includes the central and southern twothirds of the island of great britain plus such offshore islands as the isle of wight and the isles of scilly it is bordered by two other countries of the united kingdom to the north by scotland and to the west by wales england is closer than any other part of mainland britain to the european continent it is separated from france by a mile km sea gap though the two countries are connected by the channel tunnel near folkestone england also has shores on the irish sea north sea and atlantic ocean the ports of london liverpool and newcastle lie on the tidal rivers thames mersey and tyne respectively at miles km the severn is the longest river flowing through england it empties into the bristol channel and is notable for its severn bore a tidal bore which can reach metres ft in height however the longest river entirely in england is the thames which is miles km in length there are many lakes in england the largest is windermere within the aptly named lake district most of englands landscape consists of low hills and plains with upland and mountainous terrain in the north and west of the country the northern uplands include the pennines a chain of uplands dividing east and west the lake district mountains in cumbria and the cheviot hills straddling the border between england and scotland the highest point in england at metres ft is scafell pike in the lake district the shropshire hills are near wales while dartmoor and exmoor are two upland areas in the southwest of the country the approximate dividing line between terrain types is often indicated by the teesexe linein geological terms the pennines known as the backbone of england are the oldest range of mountains in the country originating from the end of the paleozoic era around million years ago their geological composition includes among others sandstone and limestone and also coal there are karst landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of yorkshire and derbyshire the pennine landscape is high moorland in upland areas indented by fertile valleys of the regions rivers they contain two national parks the yorkshire dales and the peak district in the west country dartmoor and exmoor of the southwest peninsula include upland moorland supported by granite and enjoy a mild climate both are national parksthe english lowlands are in the central and southern regions of the country consisting of green rolling hills including the cotswold hills chiltern hills north and south downs where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the cliffs of dover this also includes relatively flat plains such as the salisbury plain somerset levels south coast plain and the fens climate england has a temperate maritime climate it is mild with temperatures not much lower than degc degf in winter and not much higher than degc degf in summer the weather is damp relatively frequently and is changeable the coldest months are january and february the latter particularly on the english coast while july is normally the warmest month months with mild to warm weather are may june september and october rainfall is spread fairly evenly throughout the year important influences on the climate of england are its proximity to the atlantic ocean its northern latitude and the warming of the sea by the gulf stream rainfall is higher in the west and parts of the lake district receive more rain than anywhere else in the country since weather records began the highest temperature recorded was degc degf on july at coningsby lincolnshire while the lowest was degc degf on january in edgmond shropshire nature and wildlife the fauna of england is similar to that of other areas in the british isles with a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate life in a diverse range of nature reserves in england are designated by natural england as key places for wildlife and natural features in england they were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations nnrs are managed on behalf of the nation many by natural england themselves but also by including the members of the wildlife trusts partnership the national trust and the royal society for the protection of birds there are nnrs in england covering square kilometres square miles often they contain rare species or nationally important populations of plants and animalsthe environment agency is a public body established in and sponsored by the department for environment food and rural affairs with relating to the protection and enhancement of the environment in england the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs is the minister responsible for protection agriculture fisheries and rural communities in has a temperate oceanic climate in most areas lacking extremes of cold or heat but does have a few small areas of subarctic and warmer areas in the south west towards the north of england the climate becomes colder and most of englands mountains and high hills are located here and have a major impact on the climate and thus the local fauna of the areas deciduous woodlands are common across all of england and provide a great habitat for much of englands wildlife but these give way in northern and upland areas of england to coniferous forests mainly plantations which also benefit certain forms of wildlife some species have adapted to the expanded urban environment particularly the red fox which is the most successful urban mammal after the brown rat and other animals such as common wood pigeon both of which thrive in urban and suburban areasgrey squirrels introduced from eastern america have forced the decline of the native red squirrel due to competition red squirrels are now confined to upland and areas of england mainly in the north south west and isle of wight englands climate is very suitable for lagomorphs and the country has rabbits and brown hares which were introduced in roman times mountain hares which are indigenous have now been reintroduced in derbyshire the fauna of england has to cope with varying temperatures and conditions although not extreme they do pose potential challenges and adaptational measures english fauna has however had to cope with human population densities amongst the highest in europe and intensive farming but as england is a developed nation wildlife and the countryside have entered the english mindset more and the country is very about preserving its wildlife environment and countryside major conurbations the greater london builtup area is by far the largest urban area in england and one of the busiest cities in the world it is considered a global city and has a population larger than any other country in the united kingdom besides england itself other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in northern england or the english midlands there are settlements which have designated city status in england while the wider united kingdom has while many cities in england are quite large such as birmingham sheffield manchester liverpool leeds newcastle bradford nottingham population size is not a prerequisite for city status the status was given to towns with diocesan

relating to england govuk the official website of the british government geographic data related to england at mediawiki is a free and opensource wiki software it is used on wikipedia and almost all other wikimedia websites including wiktionary wikimedia commons and wikidata these sites define a large part of the requirement set for mediawiki it was developed for use on wikipedia in and given the name mediawiki in mediawiki was originally developed by magnus manske and improved by lee daniel crocker its development has since then been coordinated by the wikimedia foundation mediawiki is written in the php programming language and stores all text content into a database the software is optimized to efficiently handle large projects which can have terabytes of content and hundreds of thousands of views per second because wikipedia is one of the worlds largest websites achieving scalability through multiple layers of caching and database replication has been a major concern for developers another major aspect of mediawiki is its its interface is available in more than languages the software has more than settings and more than extensions available for enabling various features to be added or its use on wikimedia sites mediawiki has been used as a knowledge management and content management system on websites such as fandom wikihow and major internal like intellipedia and diplopedia license mediawiki is free and opensource and is distributed under the terms of the gnu general public license version or any later version its located at is released under the creative commons bysa license and partly in the public domain specifically the manuals and other content at mediawikiorg are creative while the set of help pages intended to be freely copied into fresh wiki andor distributed with mediawiki software is public domain this was done to eliminate legal issues arising from the help pages being imported into wikis with licenses that are incompatible with the creative commons license mediawikis development has generally favored the use of opensource media formats development mediawiki has an active volunteer community for development and maintenance users who have made meaningful to the project by submitting patches are generally upon request granted access to commit revisions to the projects gitgerrit repository there are also paid programmers who primarily develop projects for the wikimedia foundation mediawiki developers participate in the google summer of code by facilitating the assignment of mentors to students wishing to work on mediawiki core and extension projects during the year prior to november there were about two hundred developers who had committed changes to the mediawiki core or extensions major mediawiki releases are generated every six months by taking snapshots of the development branch which is kept continuously in a runnable state minor releases or point releases are issued as needed to correct bugs especially security problems mediawiki is developed on a continuous integration development model in which software changes are pushed live to wikimedia sites on regular also has a public bug tracker which runs phabricator the site is also used for feature and enhancement requests history when wikipedia was launched in january it ran on an existing wiki software system usemodwiki usemodwiki is written in the perl programming language and stores all wiki pages in text txt files this software soon proved to be limiting in both and performance in mid magnus manskea developer and student at the university of cologne as well as a wikipedia editorbegan working on new software that would replace usemodwiki specifically designed for use by wikipedia this software was written in the php scripting language and stored all of its information in a mysql engine database the new software was largely developed by august and a test wiki for it was established shortly thereafter the first full of this software was the new meta wikipedia on november there was a desire to have it implemented immediately on the wikipedia however manske was apprehensive about any potential bugs harming the nascent website during the period of the final exams he had to complete immediately prior to christmas this led to the launch on the wikipedia being delayed until january the software was then gradually deployed on all the wikipedia language sites of that time this software was referred to as the php script and as phase ii with the name phase i given to the use of usemodwiki increasing usage soon caused load problems to arise again and soon after another rewrite of the software began this time being done by lee daniel crocker which became known as phase iii this new software was also written in php with a mysql backend and kept the basic interface of the phase ii software but with the added of a wider scalability the phase iii software went live on wikipedia in july the wikimedia foundation was announced on june in july wikipedia contributor daniel mayer suggested the name mediawiki for the software as a play on wikimedia the mediawiki name was gradually phased in beginning in august the name has frequently caused confusion due to its intentional similarity to the wikimedia name which itself is similar to wikipedia the old product logo was created by erik moller using a flower photograph taken by florence and was originally submitted to the logo contest for a new wikipedia logo held from july to august the logo came in third place and was chosen to represent mediawiki rather than wikipedia with the second place logo being used for the wikimedia foundation the double square brackets symbolize the syntax mediawiki uses for creating hyperlinks to other wiki pages while the sunflower represents the diversity of content on wikipedia its constant growth and the brion vibber the chief technical officer of the wikimedia foundation took up the role of release manager and the most active milestones in mediawikis development have included the system parser functions flagged revisions the a delivery system for css and javascript and the visualeditor a what you see is what you get wysiwyg editing platform the contest of designing a new logo was initiated on june as the old logo was a bitmap image and had high details leading to problems when rendering at high and low resolutions respectively after two rounds of voting the new and current mediawiki logo designed by serhio magpie was selected on october and officially adopted on april version history the first version of mediawiki was released in december sites using mediawiki mediawikis most famous use has been in wikipedia and to a lesser degree the wikimedia foundations other projects fandom a wiki hosting service formerly known as wikia runs on mediawiki other public wikis that run on mediawiki include wikihow and snpedia wikileaks began as a site but is no longer a wiki a number of alternative wiki to wikipedia run on mediawiki including citizendium metapedia scholarpedia and mediawiki is also used internally by a large number of companies including novell and intelnotable usages of mediawiki within governments include intellipedia used by the united states intelligence community diplopedia used by the united states department of state and milwiki a part of milsuite used by the united states department of defense united nations agencies such as the united nations development programme and instraw chose to implement their wikis using mediawiki because this software runs wikipedia and is therefore guaranteed to be thoroughly tested will continue to be developed well into the future and future technicians on these wikis will be more likely to have exposure to mediawiki than any other wiki softwarethe free software foundation uses mediawiki to implement the libreplanet site key features mediawiki provides a rich core feature set and a mechanism to attach extensions to provide additional and localisation due to the strong emphasis on in the wikimedia projects and localization has received significant attention by developers the user interface has been fully or partially translated into more than languages on and can be further customized by site the entire interface is editable through the wiki several extensions most notably those collected in the mediawiki language extension bundle are designed to further enhance the and of mediawiki installation and installation of mediawiki requires that the user have privileges on a server running both php and a compatible type of sql database some users find that setting up a virtual host is helpful if the majority of ones site runs under a framework such as zope or ruby on rails that is largely incompatible with mediawiki cloud hosting can eliminate the need to deploy a new serveran installation php script is accessed via a web browser to initialize the wikis settings it prompts the user for a minimal set of required parameters leaving further changes such as enabling uploads adding a site logo and installing extensions to be made by modifying settings contained in a file called some aspects of mediawiki can be configured through special pages or by editing certain pages for instance abuse filters can be configured through a special page and certain gadgets can be added by creating javascript pages in the mediawiki namespace the mediawiki community publishes a installation guide markup one of the earliest differences between mediawiki and its predecessor usemodwiki and other wiki engines was the use of free links instead of camelcase when mediawiki was created it was typical for wikis to require text like worldwideweb to create a link to a page about the world wide web links in mediawiki on the other hand are created by surrounding words with double square brackets and any spaces between them are left intact eg world wide web this change was logical for the purpose of creating an encyclopedia where accuracy in titles is important mediawiki uses an extensible lightweight wiki markup designed to be easier to use and learn than html tools exist for converting content such as tables between mediawiki markup and html efforts have been made to create a mediawiki markup spec but a consensus seems to have been reached that wikicode requires grammar rules the following sidebyside comparison illustrates the differences between wiki markup and html quotation above from alices adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll editing interface mediawikis default pageediting tools have been described as somewhat challenging to learn a survey of students assigned to use a wiki found that when they were asked an open question about main problems with the wiki cited technical problems with formatting eg couldnt figure out how to get an image in cant figure out how to show a link with words it inserts a numberto make editing long pages easier mediawiki allows the editing of a subsection of a page as identified by its header a registered user can also indicate whether or not an edit is minor correcting spelling grammar or punctuation are examples of minor edits whereas adding paragraphs of new text is an example of a nonminor edit sometimes while one user is editing a second user saves an edit to the same part of the page then when the first user attempts to save the page an edit conflict occurs the second user is then given an opportunity to merge their content into the page as it now exists following the first users page save mediawikis user interface has been localized in many different languages a language for the wiki content itself can also be set to be sent in the http header and lang html attribute application programming interface mediawiki has an extensible web api application programming interface that provides direct highlevel access to the data contained in the mediawiki databases client programs can use the api to log in get data and post changes the api supports thin webbased javascript clients and enduser applications such as tools the api can be accessed by the backend of another web site an extensive python bot library pywikibot and a popular tool called also interface with the api the api is accessed via urls such as in this case the query would be asking wikipedia for information relating to the last edits to the site one of the perceived advantages of the api is its language independence it listens for http connections from clients and can send a response in a variety of formats such as xml serialized php or json client code has been developed to provide layers of abstraction to the api rich content mediawiki supports rich content generated through specialized syntax for example the software comes with optional support for rendering mathematical formulas using latex and a special parser written in ocaml similar for other content ranging from graphical timelines over mathematical plotting and musical scores to egyptian hieroglyphs is available via extensions the software has become more powerful at dealing with a wide variety of uploaded media files its richest is in the area of images where image galleries and thumbnails can be generated with relative ease there is also support for exif metadata the use of mediawiki to operate the wikimedia commons one of the largest free content media archives has driven the need for further in this area for wysiwyg editing visualeditor is available to use in mediawiki which simplifying editing process for editors and has been bundled since mediawiki other extensions exist for handling wysiwyg editing to different degrees tracking edits among the features of mediawiki to assist in tracking edits is a recent changes feature that provides a list of recent edits to the wiki this list contains basic information about those edits such as the editing user the edit summary the page edited as well as any tags eg possible malware link added by customizable abuse filters and other extensions to aid in combating unhelpful edits on more active wikis so many edits occur that it is hard to track recent changes manually antivandal software including userassisted tools is sometimes employed on such wikis to process recent changes items server load can be reduced by sending a continuous feed of recent changes to an irc channel that these tools can monitor eliminating their need to send requests for a refreshed recent changes feed to the apianother important tool is watchlisting each loggedin user has a watchlist to which the user can add whatever pages he or she wishes when an edit is made to one of those pages a summary of that edit appears on the watchlist the next time it is refreshed as with the recent changes page recent edits that appear on the watchlist contain clickable links for easy review of the article history and specific changes made there is also the capability to review all edits made by any particular user in this way if an edit is identified as problematic it is possible to check the users other edits for issues mediawiki allows one to link to specific versions of articles this has been useful to the scientific community in that expert peer reviewers could analyse articles improve them and provide links to the trusted version of that article navigation wikilinks navigation through the wiki is largely through internal wikilinks mediawikis wikilinks implement page existence detection in which a link is colored blue if the target page exists on the local wiki and red if it does not if a user clicks on a red link they are prompted to create an article with that title page existence detection makes it practical for users to create wikified articlesthat is articles containing links to other pertinent those other articles being yet in existence interwiki links interwiki links function much the same way as namespaces a set of interwiki prefixes can be configured to cause for instance a page title of wales to direct the user to the jimbo wales article on wikiquote unlike internal wikilinks interwiki links lack page existence detection and accordingly there is no way to tell whether a blue interwiki link is broken or not links links are the small navigation links that show up in the sidebar in most mediawiki skins that connect an article with related articles in other languages within the same wiki family this can provide communities connected by a larger context with all wikis on the same server or each on its own wikipedia used links to link an article to other articles on the same topic in other editions of wikipedia this was superseded by the launch of wikidata content organization page tabs and associated pages page tabs are displayed at the top of pages these tabs allow users to perform actions or view pages that are related to the current page the available default actions include viewing editing and discussing the current page the specific tabs displayed depend on whether the user is logged into the wiki and whether the user has sysop privileges on the wiki for instance the ability to move a page or add it to ones watchlist is usually restricted to loggedin users the site can add or remove tabs by using javascript or installing page has an associated history page from which the user can access every version of the page that has ever existed and generate diffs between two versions of his choice users are displayed not only here but also via a user option on a sidebar in a article carl challborn and teresa reimann noted that while this feature may be a slight deviation from the egoless spirit of wiki purists it can be very useful for educators who need to assess the contribution and of individual student users namespaces mediawiki provides many features beyond hyperlinks for structuring content one of the earliest such features is namespaces one of wikipedias earliest problems had been the separation of encyclopedic content from pages pertaining to maintenance and communal discussion as well as personal pages about encyclopedia editors namespaces are prefixes before a page title such as user or talk that serve as descriptors for the pages purpose and allow multiple pages with different functions to exist under the same title for instance a page titled the terminator in the default namespace could describe the movie starring arnold while a page titled userthe terminator could be a profile describing a user who chooses this name as a pseudonym more commonly each namespace has an associated talk namespace which can be used to discuss its contents such as user talk or template talk the purpose of having discussion pages is to allow content to be separated from discussion surrounding the can be viewed as folders that separate different basic types of information or custom namespaces can be added by the site there are namespaces by default for content with used for dynamically generated special pages and links to media files each namespace on mediawiki is numbered content page namespaces have even numbers and their associated talk page namespaces have odd numbers category tags users can create new categories and add pages and files to those categories by appending one or more category tags to the content text adding these tags creates links at the bottom of the page that take the reader to the list of all pages in that category making it easy to browse related articles the use of to organize content has been described as a combination of tagging systems like delicious and hierarchical like the dewey decimal subpages in addition to namespaces content can be ordered using subpages this simple feature provides automatic breadcrumbs of the pattern page titlesubpage title from the page after the slash in this case subpage title to the page before the slash in this case page title if the feature is enabled users can customize their stylesheets and configure clientside javascript to be executed with every pageview on wikipedia this has led to a large number of additional tools and helpers developed through the wiki and shared among users for instance navigation popups is a custom javascript tool that shows previews of articles when the user hovers over links and also provides shortcuts for common maintenance tasks the entire mediawiki user interface can be edited through the wiki itself by users with the necessary permissions typically called this is done through a special namespace with the prefix mediawiki where each page title identifies a particular user interface message using an extension it is also possible for a user to create personal scripts and to choose whether certain sitewide scripts should apply to them by toggling the appropriate options in the user preferences page templates the mediawiki namespace was originally also used for creating custom text blocks that could then be dynamically loaded into other pages using a special syntax this content was later moved into its own namespace template templates are text blocks that can be dynamically loaded inside another page whenever that page is requested the template is a special link in double curly brackets for example which calls the template in this case located at to load in place of the template call templates are structured documents containing pairs they are defined with parameters to which are assigned values when transcluded on an article page the name of the parameter is delimited from the value by an equals sign a class of templates known as infoboxes is used on wikipedia to collect and present a subset of information about its subject usually on the top mobile view or top righthand corner desktop view of the document a related method called template substitution called by adding subst at the beginning of a template link inserts the contents of the template into the target page like a copy and paste operation instead of loading the template contents dynamically whenever the page is loaded this can lead to when using templates but may be useful in certain cases and in most cases requires fewer server resources the actual amount of savings can vary depending on wiki and the complexity of the template templates have found many different uses templates enable users to create complex table layouts that are used consistently across multiple pages and where only the content of the tables gets inserted using template parameters templates are frequently used to identify problems with a wikipedia article by putting a template in the article this template then outputs a graphical box stating that the article content is disputed or in need of some other attention and also categorize it so that articles of this nature can be located templates are also used on user pages to send users standard messages welcoming them to the site giving them awards for outstanding warning them when their behavior is considered notifying them when they are blocked from editing and so on groups and restriction of access mediawiki offers flexibility in creating and defining user groups for instance it would be possible to create an arbitrary ninja group that can block users and delete pages and whose edits are hidden by default in the recent changes log it is also possible to set up a group of users that one becomes a member of after making a certain number of edits and waiting a certain number of days some groups that are enabled by default are bureaucrats and sysops bureaucrats have the power to change other users rights sysops have power over page protection and deletion and the blocking of users from editing mediawikis available controls on editing rights have been deemed sufficient for publishing and maintaining important documents such as a manual of standard operating procedures in a hospitalwhen a page consists only of useless content there are several ways to remove that content the simplest way available to all users is simply to blank the page however this interferes with page existence detection unless an extension is installed to treat blanked pages as though they were nonexistent blanking also leaves the content accessible through the history page an outcome that while potentially increasing transparency by allowing nonsysops to easily review the content removal decision for might be unacceptable or even unlawful in some cases another option is for a sysop to delete the page and thereby prevent it from being viewed by nonsysops another level of deletion called can be used by a group eg oversighters to prevent a page from being viewed by nonmembers of that group it is also possible using certain extensions to remove content from being viewed through any of the normal channels on the wiki or even to completely delete revisions from the comes with a basic set of features related to restricting access but its original and ongoing design is driven by functions that largely relate to content not content segregation as a result with minimal exceptions related to specific tools and their related special pages page access control has never been a high priority in core development and developers have stated that users requiring secure user access and controls should not rely on mediawiki since it was never designed for these kinds of situations for instance it is extremely difficult to create a wiki where only certain users can read and access some pages here wiki engines like foswiki moinmoin and confluence provide more flexibility by supporting advanced security mechanisms like access control lists the mediawiki codebase contains various hooks using callback functions to add additional php code in an extensible way this allows developers to write extensions without necessarily needing to modify the core or having to submit their code for review installing an extension typically consists of adding a line to the file though in some cases additional changes such as database updates or core patches are required five main extension points were created to allow developers to add features and to mediawiki hooks are run every time a certain event happens for instance the hook occurs after a save article request has been processed this can be used for example by an extension that notifies selected users whenever a page edit occurs on the wiki from new or anonymous users new tags can be created to process data with opening and closing tags newtagnewtag parser functions can be used to create a new command if new special pages can be created to perform a specific function these pages are dynamically generated for example a special page might show all pages that have one or more links to an external site or it might create a form providing user submitted feedback skins allow users to customize the look and feel of mediawiki a minor extension point allows the use of amazon s to host image files extensions resources to developers mediawiki can be made more advanced and useful for various purposes through its extensions these extensions vary greatly in complexity the wikimedia foundation operates a git server where many extensions host their repository most of them also have a page on the mediawiki website mediawiki code review was itself historically facilitated through a mediawiki extension as of march it has been done through gerrit since version mediawiki uses the jquery library text manipulation among the most popular extensions is a parser function extension which allows different content to be rendered based on the result of conditional statements these conditional statements can perform functions such as evaluating whether a parameter is empty comparing strings evaluating mathematical expressions and returning one of two values depending on whether a page exists it was designed as a replacement for a notoriously inefficient template called qif schindler recounts the history of the extension as follows in some wikipedians discovered that through an intricate and complicated interplay of templating features and css they could create conditional wiki text ie text that was displayed if a template parameter had a specific value this included repeated calls of templates within templates which bogged down the performance of the whole system the developers faced the choice of either disallowing the spreading of an obviously desired feature by detecting such usage and explicitly disallowing it within the software or offering an efficient alternative the latter was done by tim starling who announced the introduction of parser functions wiki text that calls functions implemented in the underlying software at first only conditional text and the computation of simple mathematical expressions were implemented but this already increased the for wiki editors enormously with time further parser functions were introduced finally leading to a framework that allowed the simple writing of extension functions to add arbitrary like eg geocoding services or widgets this time the developers were clearly reacting to the demand of the community being forced either to fight the solution of the issue that the community had ie conditional text or offer an improved technical to replace the previous practice and achieve an overall better performance another parser functions extension was developed to allow evaluation of string length string position and so on wikimedia communities having created awkward workarounds to accomplish the same clamored for it to be enabled on their projects much of its was eventually integrated into the extension albeit disabled by default and accompanied by a warning from tim starling that enabling string functions would allow users to implement their own parsers in the ugliest most inefficient programming language known to man mediawiki wikitext with an extension scribunto has existed that allows for the creation of moduleswiki pages written in the scripting language luawhich can then be run within templates and standard wiki pages scribunto has been installed on wikipedia and other wikimedia sites since and is used heavily on those sites scribunto code runs faster than wikitext code using for footnotes and display another very popular extension is a citation extension that enables footnotes to be added to pages using inline references this extension has however been criticized for being difficult to use and requiring the user to memorize complex syntax a gadget called reftoolbar attempts to make it easier to create citations using common templates mediawiki has some extensions that are wellsuited for academia such as mathematics extensions and an extension that allows molecules to be rendered in d integration a generic widgets extension exists that allows mediawiki to integrate with virtually anything other examples of extensions that could improve a wiki are category suggestion extensions and extensions for inclusion of flash videos youtube videos and rss feeds metavid a site that archives video footage of the us senate and house floor proceedings was created using code extending mediawiki into the domain of video authoring combating linkspam there are many spambots that search the web for mediawiki and add linkspam to them despite the fact that mediawiki uses the nofollow attribute to discourage such attempts at search engine optimization part of the problem is that third party republishers such as mirrors may not implement the nofollow tag on their websites so marketers can still get pagerank benefit by inserting links into pages when those entries appear on third party websites antispam extensions have been developed to combat the problem by introducing captchas blacklisting certain urls and allowing bulk deletion of pages recently added by a particular user searches and queries mediawiki comes preinstalled with a standard textbased search extensions exist to let mediawiki use more thirdparty search engines including which since has been in use on wikipedia lucene and mediawiki extensions have also been created to allow for more complex faceted search on both data entered within the wiki and on metadata such as pages revision mediawiki is one such extension database mediawiki can use either the mysqlmariadb postgresql or sqlite relational database management system support for oracle database and microsoft sql server has been dropped since mediawiki a mediawiki database contains several dozen tables including a page table that contains page titles page ids and other metadata and a revision table to which is added a new row every time an edit is made containing the page id a brief textual summary of the change performed the user name of the article editor or its ip address the case of an unregistered user and a timestampin a year period prior to the mediawiki database had schema versions possibly the largest schema change was done in with mediawiki when the storage of metadata was separated from that of content to improve performance flexibility when this upgrade was applied to wikipedia the site was locked for editing and the schema was converted to the new version in about hours some software enhancement proposals such as a proposal to allow sections of articles to be watched via watchlist have been rejected because the necessary schema changes would have required excessive wikipedia downtime performance and storage because it is used to run one of the sites on the web wikipedia mediawikis performance and scalability have been highly optimized mediawiki supports squid loadbalanced database replication clientside caching memcached or tablebased caching for frequently accessed processing of query results a simple static file cache operation revision compression and a job queue for database operations mediawiki developers have attempted to optimize the software by avoiding expensive algorithms database queries etc caching every result that is expensive and has temporal locality of reference and focusing on the hot spots in the code through code is designed to allow for data to be written to a readwrite database and read from readonly databases although the readwrite database can be used for some read operations if the readonly databases are not yet up to date metadata such as article revision history article relations links categories etc user accounts and settings can be stored in core databases and cached the actual revision text being more rarely used can be stored as appendonly blobs in external storage the software is suitable for the operation of largescale wiki farms such as wikimedia which had about wikis as of august however mediawiki comes with no builtin gui to manage such empirical evidence shows most revisions in mediawiki databases tend to differ only slightly from previous revisions therefore subsequent revisions of an article can be concatenated and then compressed achieving very high data compression ratios of up to xfor more information on the architecture such as how it stores wikitext and assembles a page see external links limitations the parser serves as the de facto standard for the mediawiki syntax as no formal syntax has been defined due to this lack of a formal definition it has been difficult to create wysiwyg editors for mediawiki although several wysiwyg extensions do exist including the popular visualeditor mediawiki is not designed to be a suitable replacement for dedicated online forum or blogging software although extensions do exist to allow for both of theseit is common for new mediawiki users to make certain mistakes such as forgetting to sign posts with four tildes or manually entering a plaintext signature due to with the particulars involved in on mediawiki discussion pages on the other hand the format of these discussion pages has been cited as a strength by one educator who stated that it provides more finegrain capabilities for discussion than traditional threaded discussion forums for example instead of replying to an entire message the participant in a discussion can create a hyperlink to a new wiki page on any word from the original page discussions are easier to follow since the content is available via hyperlinked wiki page rather than a series of reply messages on a traditional threaded discussion forum however except in few cases students were not using this capability possibly because of their familiarity with the traditional linear discussion style and a lack of guidance on how to make the content more by default has little support for the creation of dynamically assembled documents or pages that aggregate data from other pages some research has been done on enabling such features directly within mediawiki the semantic mediawiki extension provides these features it is not in use on wikipedia but in more than other mediawiki the wikibase repository and wikibase repository client are however implemented in wikidata and wikipedia respectively and to some extent provides semantic web features and linking of centrally stored data to infoboxes in various wikipedia articles upgrading mediawiki is usually fully automated requiring no changes to the site content or template programming historically troubles have been encountered when upgrading from older versions security mediawiki developers have enacted security standards both for core code and extensions sql queries and html output are usually done through wrapper functions that handle validation escaping filtering for prevention of crosssite scripting and sql injection many security issues have had to be patched after a mediawiki version release and accordingly mediawikiorg states the most important security step you can take is to keep your software up to date by subscribing to the announcement listserv and installing security updates that are announced developer community mediawiki developers are spread around the world though with a majority in the united states and europe facetoface meetings and programming sessions for mediawiki developers have been held once or several times a year since support support for mediawiki users consists of mediawikiorg including the support desk an official mailing list mediawikil several books have been written about mediawiki including some free online books comparison to other online software users of online software are familiar with mediawikis functions and layout due to its noted use on wikipedia a overview of social software in academia observed that compared to other wikis mediawiki is also fairly pleasing though simple and has an easily customized side menu and stylesheet however in one assessment in confluence was deemed to be a superior product due to its very usable api and ability to better support multiple wikisa study at the university of hong kong compared twiki to mediawiki the authors noted that twiki has been considered as a tool for the development of educational papers and technical projects whereas mediawikis most noted use is on wikipedia although both platforms allow discussion and tracking of progress twiki has a report part that mediawiki lacks students perceived mediawiki as being easier to use and more enjoyable than twiki when asked whether they recommended using mediawiki for knowledge management course group project out of respondents expressed their preference for mediawiki giving answers of great certainty such as of course for sure twiki and mediawiki both have flexible plugin study that compared students experience with mediawiki to that with google docs found that students gave the latter a much higher rating on userfriendly layouta study conducted by the brazilian nuclear engineering institute compared a knowledge management system against two others that were based on dspace and open journal systems respectively it highlighted ease of use as an advantage of the system noting that because the wikimedia foundation had been developing mediawiki for a site aimed at the general public wikipedia its user interface was designed to be more userfriendly from start and has received large user feedback over a long time in contrast to dspaces and ojss focus on niche audiences see also list of content management systems
